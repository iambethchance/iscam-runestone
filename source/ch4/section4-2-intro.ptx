  <title>Comparing Two Population Means</title>
  
  <p>In this section, we want to focus on quantitative data arising from two independent random samples. For example, in the first investigation you will compare the average travel distances of African and Asian elephants. For statistical inference, we need to explore how statistics like the difference in sample means behave under random sampling. We will first explore a hypothetical situation and then we then discuss a theoretical result justifying use of a t-distribution for the reference distribution in finding p-values and confidence intervals.</p>
