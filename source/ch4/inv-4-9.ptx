  <title>Investigation 4.9: Speed It Up (cont.)</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Recall that student researchers wanted to compare the mean typing speed with and without up-tempo music.</p>
    <p><m>H_0: \mu_{music} - \mu_{nomusic} = 0</m> (no difference in the long run average speed)</p>
    <p><m>H_a: \mu_{music} - \mu_{nomusic} > 0</m> (on average typing speed is faster with up-tempo music)</p>
    <p>Below are the results from the students' paired design.</p>

    <title>Key Idea</title>
    <p>When the data are paired (e.g., repeat observations on the same observational unit) we should not treat the two samples as independent. This ignores the information that two measurements were taken for each observational unit (we couldn't mix up the values in the second column without altering the information in the data).</p>
  </assemblage>
  
  <p>As suggested in Investigation 4.8(j), we can use the differences as the response variable.</p>

  <p>It actually doesn't matter whether we use the "difference in means" or the "mean difference" as our statistic/parameter. What is important is how we estimate the chance variation in that statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>

    <title>Simulation Design</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Outline (pseudo-code) how you could use a coin to simulate a randomization test for paired data to compare the two sets of measurements to assess how unusual it is for the average difference in typing speeds to be at least this extreme just by chance. Keep in mind that you want the simulation to mimic the randomization process used in the study design, assuming the presence/absence of music does not affect typing speed.</p>

  <p>Copy and paste the original raw data (TypingMusic.txt) into the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/anovashuffle/AnovaShuffle.htm?hideExtras=2">Matched Pairs Randomization applet</url>:</p>
  
  <p>View the data window, with one column for the speeds with music and a second column for the speeds without music (each row is one person). You can also include an initial column of identifiers (e.g., student IDs or initials). The dotplots should then show both sets of data, connecting the paired observations, and their differences.</p>

    <title>Definitions: Paired t-test</title>
    <p>A paired <em>t</em>-test standardizes the mean of the differences from a matched-pairs design.</p>
    <p><me>t = \frac{\bar{x}_{diff} - 0}{s_{diff}/\sqrt{n_{diff}}}</me></p>
    <p>where <m>\bar{x}_{diff}</m> is the sample mean of differences and <m>s_{diff}</m> is the sample standard deviation of the differences. The standardized statistic above assumes the hypothesized difference is zero, but this can be changed.</p>
    <p><alert>Technical conditions:</alert> When the distribution of differences is normally distributed or the sample size is large (e.g., <m>n > 30</m> pairs of observations), this <em>t</em>-statistic is well modeled by a <em>t</em>-distribution with <m>n - 1</m> degrees of freedom.</p>
    <p>A paired <em>t</em>-confidence interval for <m>\mu_d</m> has the form <m>\bar{x}_{diff} \pm t_{n-1}^* \times (s_{diff}/\sqrt{n_{diff}})</m></p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>To compare two groups on a quantitative variable, a more powerful study design than randomly assigning individuals to two groups, if possible, is to pair individuals (or take two measurements on each individual) and measure both responses in each pair (See Example 4.4). This pairing accounts for the variability from individual to individual and allows for a more direct comparison between the two conditions of interest. For example, if two measurements are taken on each individual, there should not be any other systematic differences between the measurements other than the treatment effect. Randomizing will still be important in determining the order of the two treatments, thereby eliminating order as a potential confounding variable. By accounting for the variability in individuals, this should increase the power of the test of significance, making it easier to detect a difference between the two conditions if one really exists. To analyze such data, perform a matched-pairs randomization test or a (one sample) <em>t</em>-test on the differences.</p>
    <p><alert>Note:</alert> The standard error of the difference in means is equivalent to <m>SE(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2 + s_2^2 - 2rs_1s_2}{n}}</m>, which shows how the positive correlation between the two sets of measurements (<m>r</m>) reduces the estimated standard error of the statistic.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>A paired experiment comparing typing speeds with and without up-tempo classical music (Overture to Candide performed by the London Symphony Orchestra) found participants were significantly faster on average with the music. A paired <em>t</em>-test on the mean difference give a one-sided p-value of 0.006, similar to the simulation-based p-value using "random swapping" of the speeds to represent no difference between the two treatment conditions. We are 95% confident that participants like those in this study (e.g., college students, music students or athletes willing to help out a friend) type, on average, 0.63 to 4.61 more words per minute when listening to the up-tempo music. This evidence is much stronger than when we only compared the participants on their first tests, because of both effectively doubling the sample size and also reducing the amount of "unexplained variation" in the response variable. The person-to-person variation in typing speeds was around 15 wpm, compared to the person-to-person variation in difference in typing speeds which was around 5 wpm. A further analysis could compare the average improvement with music between the music students and the athletes.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>Scientists have long been interested in whether there are physiological indicators of diseases such as schizophrenia. In a 1990 study by Suddath et. al., reported in Ramsey and Schafer (2002), researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the volumes of various regions of the brain for a sample of 15 monozygotic twins, where one twin was affected by schizophrenia and other not ("unaffected"). The twins were found in a search through the United States and Canada, the ages ranged from 25 to 44 years, with 8 male and 7 female pairs. The data (in cubic centimeters) for the left hippocampus region of the brain are in hippocampus.txt. The primary research question is whether the data provide evidence of a difference in hippocampus volumes between those affected by schizophrenia and those unaffected.</p>
