  <title>Investigation 4.9: Speed It Up (cont.)</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Recall that student researchers wanted to compare the mean typing speed with and without up-tempo music.</p>
    <p><m>H_0: \mu_{music} - \mu_{nomusic} = 0</m> (no difference in the long run average speed)</p>
    <p><m>H_a: \mu_{music} - \mu_{nomusic} > 0</m> (on average typing speed is faster with up-tempo music)</p>
    <p>Below are the results from the students' paired design.</p>

    <title>Key Idea</title>
    <p>When the data are paired (e.g., repeat observations on the same observational unit) we should not treat the two samples as independent. This ignores the information that two measurements were taken for each observational unit (we couldn't mix up the values in the second column without altering the information in the data).</p>
  </assemblage>
  
  <p>As suggested in Investigation 4.8(j), we can use the differences as the response variable.</p>

  <p>View the data window, with one column for the speeds with music and a second column for the speeds without music (each row is one person).

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>To compare two groups on a quantitative variable, a more powerful study design than randomly assigning individuals to two groups, if possible, is to pair individuals (or take two measurements on each individual) and measure both responses in each pair (See Example 4.4). This pairing accounts for the variability from individual to individual and allows for a more direct comparison between the two conditions of interest. For example, if two measurements are taken on each individual, there should not be any other systematic differences between the measurements other than the treatment effect. Randomizing will still be important in determining the order of the two treatments, thereby eliminating order as a potential confounding variable. By accounting for the variability in individuals, this should increase the power of the test of significance, making it easier to detect a difference between the two conditions if one really exists. To analyze such data, perform a matched-pairs randomization test or a (one sample) <em>t</em>-test on the differences.</p>
    <p><alert>Note:</alert> The standard error of the difference in means is equivalent to <m>SE(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2 + s_2^2 - 2rs_1s_2}{n}}</m>, which shows how the positive correlation between the two sets of measurements (<m>r</m>) reduces the estimated standard error of the statistic.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>A paired experiment comparing typing speeds with and without up-tempo classical music (Overture to Candide performed by the London Symphony Orchestra) found participants were significantly faster on average with the music. A paired <em>t</em>-test on the mean difference give a one-sided p-value of 0.006, similar to the simulation-based p-value using "random swapping" of the speeds to represent no difference between the two treatment conditions. We are 95% confident that participants like those in this study (e.g., college students, music students or athletes willing to help out a friend) type, on average, 0.63 to 4.61 more words per minute when listening to the up-tempo music. This evidence is much stronger than when we only compared the participants on their first tests, because of both effectively doubling the sample size and also reducing the amount of "unexplained variation" in the response variable. The person-to-person variation in typing speeds was around 15 wpm, compared to the person-to-person variation in difference in typing speeds which was around 5 wpm. A further analysis could compare the average improvement with music between the music students and the athletes.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>Scientists have long been interested in whether there are physiological indicators of diseases such as schizophrenia. In a 1990 study by Suddath et. al., reported in Ramsey and Schafer (2002), researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the volumes of various regions of the brain for a sample of 15 monozygotic twins, where one twin was affected by schizophrenia and other not ("unaffected"). The twins were found in a search through the United States and Canada, the ages ranged from 25 to 44 years, with 8 male and 7 female pairs. The data (in cubic centimeters) for the left hippocampus region of the brain are in hippocampus.txt. The primary research question is whether the data provide evidence of a difference in hippocampus volumes between those affected by schizophrenia and those unaffected.</p>

      <p>The sample sizes are larger which would lower the p-value. The standard deviations have changed a bit but in general are similar in magnitude to before. The sample means have changed a bit, but in general are similar in magnitude to before. If anything, the difference in mean typing speed between the two groups is a bit smaller which would raise the p-value.</p>

      <p>The distribution of differences in typing speeds is slightly skewed to the right with a mean difference of 2.62 wpm and a standard deviation of 5.71 wpm.

      <title>Solution to (g)</title>
      <p>For each participant, we could randomly determine which of their typing speed measurements was measured with music and which without music. To do this, we would flip a coin. If the coin lands heads up, change the sign of the difference (so switch the music and no-music results). If the coin lands tails up, keep the results with their original labels (the difference would not change). Flip the coin for all 34 participants, find the (new) difference for each person and find the mean of these differences, <m>\bar{x}_d</m>. Repeat this "swapping" process a large number of times and look at the distribution of the <m>\bar{x}_d</m> values. Then count how many of these simulated <m>\bar{x}_d</m> values are at least as extreme as the <m>-2.62</m> we observed in our study (where "as extreme" would mean <m>\bar{x} > 2.62</m> and <m>\bar{x} \lt -2.62</m> for our two-sided alternative).</p>

      <p>Pseudo code:</p>
      <pre>

We don't have a lot of information about how the sample was selected, but it does not appear to be random sampling and we should be cautious in generalizing these results beyond the musicians and athletes at this university.</p>
