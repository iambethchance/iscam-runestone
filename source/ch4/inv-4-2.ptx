  <title>Section 2: Comparing Two Population Means</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>In this section, we want to focus on quantitative data arising from two independent random samples. For example, in the first investigation you will compare the average travel distances of African and Asian elephants. For statistical inference, we need to explore how statistics like the difference in sample means behave under random sampling. We will first explore a hypothetical situation and then we then discuss a theoretical result justifying use of a <m>t</m>-distribution for the reference distribution in finding p-values and confidence intervals.</p>

    <title>Investigation 4.2: The Elephants in the Room</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <sidebyside widths="60% 25%" valign="top">
      <p>Researchers Holdgate et al. (<url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4944962/">2016</url>) studied walking behavior of elephants in North American zoos to see whether there is a difference in average distance traveled by African and Asian elephants in captivity. They put GPS loggers on 33 African elephants and 23 Asian elephants, and measured the distance (in kilometers) the elephants walked per day.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Identify the observational units and variable of interest. Is the variable quantitative or categorical? Which graphs and numbers might you use to compare these two species?</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Observation units = 56 elephants, Variable = How many km did the elephant walk per day? This is a quantitative variable. We could look at dotplots, boxplots, histograms, means/SDs, five number summaries in order to compare the walking distances.</p>

      <p><strong>Discussion:</strong> The sample sizes of 20 for each group appear to be large enough for a <m>t</m>-distribution (even a normal distribution) to reasonably approximate the distribution of this statistic. If the population distributions had themselves been normally distributed (and large), then a <m>t</m>-distribution will be a good approximation of the statistic for any sample sizes. The more skewed the population shapes, the larger the sample sizes need to be for you to safely use the <m>t</m>-distribution. Notice even with these very skewed populations, because their shapes and sample sizes were similar, we didn't need very large sample sizes at all for the standardized statistic to follow a <m>t</m>-distribution.</p>
      
      <p>One remaining question is what to use for the degrees of freedom for the <m>t</m>-distribution. In the one-sample case (Chapter 2) we used <m>n - 1</m>. For two samples, it's actually more complicated. The <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/glossary_files/Satterthwaite.htm">Welch-Satterthwaite</url> approximation for degrees of freedom involves the sample sizes and the unknown population standard deviations, though it doesn't always result in integer values. We will leave this calculation up to technology. You only need to realize that the degrees of freedom are related to the sample sizes and as the sample sizes become large, the <m>t</m>-distribution loses more and more of the heaviness in the tails and approaches the (standard) normal distribution. If you need to determine a p-value or critical value <q>by hand,</q> we suggest using the following simple approximation for the degrees of freedom: <m>\min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1)</m>, the smaller of the two sample sizes minus one.</p>
      
      
      <sidebyside widths="60% 35%" valign="top">
        <p>In this case, we could use 19 as the approximate degrees of freedom. Notice that this sample size is large enough that the <m>t</m>-distribution looks a lot like the normal distribution as well, which should agree with your observation in Checkpoint 15.1.29. But we will continue to use the <m>t</m>-distribution rather than the normal distribution to still account for additional variation from our estimates of the population standard deviations.</p>

<p><alert>Using Technology to Carry out the Two-Sample <m>t</m>-Tests</alert>
In using technology, you need to consider how the data are available: Do you have the “raw data” (meaning all the individual data values) or just the summary statistics (sample sizes, means, SDs)? Most software packages will assume raw data is “stacked” – each column represents a different variable (all response variable values in one column, the explanatory variable in a second column). Also notice that being able to run the <m>t</m>-test 
with only the summary data is one advantage the <m>t</m>-test has over the simulation. But also keep in mind that the t-output is valid only when the population distributions are normal or the sample sizes are large. When reporting your results, make sure you specify which technology you used, because different software use different degrees of freedom. You will also need to watch for the direction of subtraction that the software packages use automatically (often alphabetical by group name).</p>

<p>There is also a version of the two-sample <m>t</m>-test that makes an additional assumption – the population standard deviations are equal. The standardized statistic has the following form:
  <me>t = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - 0}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}</me>
  where <m>s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}</m>, a pooled estimate of the common SD.</p>
<p>This <q>pooled <m>t</m>-test</q> has some advantages (namely higher power), when the population standard deviations are equal. However, this additional condition can be difficult to assess from your sample data. The benefits do not appear to outweigh the risks of applying this assumption when you shouldn't. So in this text we will focus on <q>unpooled <m>t</m>-tests</q> only.</p>

        <p>In this study, the mean distance walked is similar for these two species (5.40 vs. 5.30 km) and the sample sizes are not super large (33 and 23), with a fair bit of variation in walking distances within each species (<m>s_{\text{African}} = 1.47</m> vs <m>s_{\text{Asian}} = 3.41</m> km). For these reasons, we do not expect a small p-value. The distributions are fairly symmetric so the unpooled <m>t</m>-test should be valid (the standard deviations are not very similar, so we would not feel comfortable assuming equal population variances). The unpooled <m>t</m>-test statistic of 0.131 is small, yielding a two-sided p-value of 0.897. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the population mean walking distances are the same. These data do not provide convincing evidence of a difference in walking distances, on average, between Asian and African elephants in American zoos. A 95% confidence interval tells us that its plausible that, in these two populations, African elephants average up to 1.45 km less to 1.65 km more than Asian elephants. It might be interesting to further explore the larger variation in walking distances among the Asian elephants. We should also be aware that we have sampled a large fraction of the populations and should consider some <q>finite population corrections</q> which would only further increase the standard deviation.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind that the <m>t</m>-tests only tell us about whether the centers of the distributions are significantly different. They don't help us analyze other potentially interesting differences in the two distributions.</p>

          <p>(b) Identify any elephants that were selected more than once, and explain how you can tell, AND how you can tell that the two groups were not pooled together before sampling.</p>
          
          <p>(c) Now check the Pooled box and press Bootstrap Samples. Include a screen capture of your bootstrap sample.</p>
          
          <p>(d) Identify any elephants that were selected more than once, and explain how you can tell, AND how you can tell that the two groups were pooled together before sampling. (Feel free to generate a different sample if another one would make your point better.)</p>
          
          <p>(e) Which simulation should we use for a test of significance, and which for a confidence interval? Briefly explain why.</p>

        <title>Bootstrap for Medians</title>
        <statement>
          <p>(a) Use the Two sample bootstrapping applet (see also Exploration 2.9) to simulate a null distribution for the difference in medians. Do you think a t-approximation would be valid for this statistic? Why or why not.</p>
          
          <p>(b) Approximate a p-value. Is your conclusion similar as in the analysis with means?</p>
          
          <p>(c) Has your analysis proven that there is no difference in the median walking distances between these two species? Explain.</p>
