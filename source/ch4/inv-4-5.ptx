  <introduction>
    <p>Reconsider the exact randomization distribution of the differences in sample means for the Sleep Deprivation study. Previously you determined simulation-based p-values and the exact p-value. Now we will explore modeling the randomization distribution of the difference in sample means with a probability distribution.</p>

    <title>Standard Error Estimation</title>
    
    <p>In Investigation 4.2, we estimated the standard error of the difference in sample means using the sample standard deviations:</p>
    <p><me>SE(\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}</me></p>
    
    <exercise xml:id="inv4-5-c" label="I4.5.3">
      <title>Compute Standard Error</title>
      <statement>
        <p>For the sleep deprivation data, the sample standard deviations are:</p>
        <p><m>s_{\text{unrestricted}} = 14.73</m> ms and <m>s_{\text{deprived}} = 12.17</m> ms</p>
        <p>Use these values to compute the standard error for the difference in sample means. Compare this to the standard deviation you observed in the applet/for the exact randomization distribution. In particular, does this formula appear to over- or under-estimate the variability?</p>
        <p>Standard error = <var width="20"/></p>
        <p>Comparison: <var width="60"/></p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>SE = <m>\sqrt{14.73^2/10 + 12.17^2/11} \approx 5.93</m></p>
        <p>This should be somewhat near the simulated value but does slightly underestimate the variability (SD = 6.74).</p>
      </solution>
      <response/>
    </exercise>
    
  <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> In Investigation 4.2, we stated that <m>SD(\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2) = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}</m>, because under the assumption that the two samples are independent, variances add. In a randomization test, however, the two samples are not independent: If one group gets all of the large responses, the other group must have all of the small responses and the difference in group means will be large. Consequently, the standard error formula from Investigation 4.2 will underestimate the shuffle-to-shuffle variation in the statistic. The discrepancy between the standard deviations for the difference in means is largest when the groups are more different: When we shuffle the responses back to the groups, any value can go into either group, but if there is a genuine difference between the treatments, then a score of 40 would be unlikely to come from say the deprived treatment. So how do we estimate the standard deviation of the randomization distribution? Turns out, we are less concerned with that. What we really want to be able to do is predict the behavior of the standardized statistic.</p>

    <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> The <em>t</em>-distribution comes to the rescue again, compensating for the underestimation in the variability, and in most situations (moderate and large sample sizes) gives an adequate approximation to the exact randomization distribution. Note the applet reports 17.56 as the degrees of freedom. This comes from the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/glossary_files/Satterthwaite.htm">Welch-Satterthwaite approximation</url> because the exact degrees of freedom are unknown in this case.</p>
    
    <p>We will consider the <em>t</em> distribution to be a reasonable approximation for the randomization distribution of the <em>t</em> statistic as long as either (similar to what you witnessed in Investigation 4.2):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The data in both groups are symmetric and bell-shaped. When this is the case, we have evidence that the <q>treatment populations</q> are normally distributed. When this is true, the randomization distribution of the differences in group means will also follow a normal distribution.</p></li></ul>
      <p>OR</p><ul><li><p>The two sample sizes are large. Typically, the sample sizes can be as small as 5, especially if the two groups have similar sample sizes and similar distribution shapes, but conventionally 20 is used as cut-off for how large each sample should be to use this approximation. Examine graphs of your data first. If the sample distributions are not symmetric or have unusual observations, you will want larger sample sizes.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
  <p>In summary, we will often apply the same two-sample <em>t</em>-procedures to both randomized experiments and to independent random samples. The distinction between these two sources of randomness will be most important in drawing your final conclusions (e.g., causation, generalizability). The advantage to the <em>t</em>-procedures over the exact randomization distribution is convenience, especially in calculating a confidence interval.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>The approximate p-value from the (unpooled, independent samples) two-sample <em>t</em>-test (0.0076, df = 17.56) also provides very strong evidence that the observed difference between the two groups did not arise by chance alone. Therefore, if we were to perform unlimited administrations of the same training and reaction time test under the exact same conditions, we have convincing evidence that the long-run mean of all improvement scores that an individual would have under sleep deprivation is lower, three days later, than the theoretical mean of all improvement scores that an individual would have with unrestricted sleep (i.e., <m>\mu_{\text{sleepdeprived}} &lt; \mu_{\text{unrestricted}}</m>). We are 95% confident that the long-run mean improvement under the <q>no restriction</q> treatment is 3.44 to 28.40 ms faster that the long-run mean improvement under the <q>sleep deprivation</q> treatment. However, we still need to worry about what larger population these individuals represent.</p>
