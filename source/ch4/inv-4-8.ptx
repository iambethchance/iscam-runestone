  <title>Investigation 4.8: Speed It Up</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Student researchers (Coutin <ampersand/> Heffler, 2021) wanted to know whether listening to up-tempo music causes college students to tend to type faster. To collect their data (number of words typed correctly in one minute), the students planned to use the 60-second Easy-Text typing test (TypingTest.com). They recruited 34 college students from groups they were associated with on campus (e.g., athletic teams, musical groups). For the up-tempo music they selected Overture to Candide performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.</p>
    
    <p>Let <m>\mu_{nomusic}</m> represent the population mean typing speed without the music and <m>\mu_{music}</m> the population mean typing speed with the music.</p>

    <title>Examine Distributions</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Do you see much of a difference between the two distributions? What is the observed difference in the sample means? Do you think this difference in sample means will be statistically significant? Explain.</p>

    <title>Validity of Two-Sample t-Test</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Is a two-sample <em>t</em>-test likely valid for these data? Explain.</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>The one-sided p-value from a two-sample <em>t</em>-test is 0.2299, failing to provide convincing evidence that the average typing speed is faster with (this) music than the average typing speed without music. But maybe there is a genuine difference and our sample sizes are just too small to detect it.</p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv4-8-f" label="I4.8.6">
    <title>Impact of Sample Size</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Suppose everything else remained the same but the sample sizes had been 34 in each group. How would that impact the p-value? By a lot or by a little? Would the difference now be statistically significant?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>Increasing the sample size helps reduce the "random chance" variation in our statistic, but does not reduce the person-to-person variation in typing speeds. When the person-to-person variation is large, it will still be difficult for us to detect the underlying treatment difference in treatment means even if one truly exists. If the actual difference in typing speeds is 4 words per minute on average, we would need sample sizes on the order of 100 participants, in each group, to have at least 80% power.</p>

    <title>Definition: Paired Design</title>
    <p>In a paired design, rather than splitting the observational units into two distinct groups, they are paired in a way where we expect the observations within a pair to be more similar to each other than to observations in other pairs. This can explain some variation in the response variable.</p>
    <p>For example, we can have each person take the typing test both with and without music. This allows us to compare the two typing speeds for each individual to each other, which should be very similar apart from the music, and to account for variation in typing speeds across individuals.</p>
