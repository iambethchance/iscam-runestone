  <title>Investigation 4.11: Smoke Alarms</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>A study published in the journal Pediatrics (Smith et al., 2006) addressed the important issue of how to awaken children during a house fire so they can escape safely. Researchers worked with a volunteer sample of 24 healthy children aged 6-12 by training them to perform a simulated self-rescue escape procedure when they heard an alarm. Researchers then compared the children's reactions to two kinds of alarms: a conventional smoke alarm and a personalized recording of the mother's voice saying the child's name and urging him or her to wake up. All 24 children were exposed to both kinds of alarms, with the order determined randomly.</p>

    <title>Initial Analysis</title>
    <statement>
      <p>What proportion of children woke up to the conventional alarm and what proportion woke up to the mother's voice? Does this provide preliminary evidence that the mother's voice alarm is more effective? State the hypotheses of interest. Could you make a two-way table for these data? Could we carry out Fisher's Exact Test or a two-sample <em>z</em>-test to assess statistical significance?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>The initial analysis reveals the proportion waking to the mother's voice was larger than the proportion that woke to the conventional alarm, but we can't consider these two independent samples – it's the same children! This is again a matched pairs design, but with a categorical response.</p>

    <title>Simulation Consideration</title>

  </exercise>
  
  <p>As before, with a matched pairs design we will focus on the differences in responses. First, we need an appropriate way to organize the data. We can do this with a two-way table looking at the two variables measured on each children – whether or not woke up to mom's voice and whether or not woke up to the conventional alarm.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>In this study, nine children reacted differently to the two alarms. If there were no effect from the type of alarm, we would expect half the children to respond to the mother's voice but not the conventional alarm and the other half of the children to respond to the conventional alarm but not the mother's voice. Instead, all 9 of the one-alarm children responded to the mother's voice but not the conventional alarm. This provides evidence that the mother's voice is more effective than the conventional alarm. To see whether this difference is statistically significant, we can calculate the binomial probability (assuming <m>n = 9</m> and <m>\pi = 0.5</m>) to determine the exact p-value <m>P(X \geq 9) = 0.00195</m>. (Or we could use simulation for one proportion. The sample size <m>n = 9</m> is too small to use a theory-based approach.) This provides strong evidence (p-value <m>&lt; 0.05</m>) that the observed result did not arise from the randomness in the process alone (which alarm was tested first). Because this was a randomized matched-pairs experiment, we will attribute this difference to the type of alarm. Keep in mind that this was a sample of volunteers and may not represent a larger population of children.</p>

      <p><ul>
        <li><p>Obs units: 24 children</p></li>
        <li><p>Explanatory variable: What type of alarm was used? Type: binary categorical</p></li>
        <li><p>Response variable: Did the child wake? Type: binary categorical</p></li>

    </solution>

    <solution>
      <title>Solution to (b)</title>
      <p>The research question is whether a child was more likely to wake up to the mom's voice than to the conventional alarm. If we let <m>\pi_1</m> and <m>\pi_2</m> represent these two probabilities, we can write this as <m>H_0: \pi_1 = \pi_2</m> vs <m>H_a: \pi_1 > \pi_2</m> but we need to keep in mind that these are not independent samples. In the data, <m>23/24 \approx 0.958</m> woke up to the mom's voice; <m>14/24 \approx 0.583</m> woke up to the conventional alarm. This provides strong preliminary evidence that the probability of waking is larger with the mom's voice, but we can't apply Fisher's Exact Test because this was not a randomized experiment with two separate treatments - we do not have two independent random samples.</p>
    </solution>

    <solution>
      <title>Solution to (c)</title>
      <p>It's not clear which column (mom's voice or conventional alarm) would be considered the response variable, but if we mix up the entries in one column, most of the rows will not see a change because most of the rows are (awake, awake) anyway.</p>
