  <title>Investigation 4.1: Employment Discrimination?</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>Robert Martin turned 55 in 1991. Earlier in that same year, the Westvaco Corporation, which makes paper products, decided to downsize. They ended up laying off roughly half of the 50 employees in the engineering department where Martin worked, including Martin. Later that year, Martin went to court, claiming that he had been fired because of his age. A major piece of evidence in Martin's case was based on a statistical analysis of the relationship between the ages of the workers and whether they lost their jobs.</p>
    
    <p>Part of the data analysis presented at his trial concerned the ten hourly workers who were at risk of layoff in the second of five rounds of reductions. At the beginning of Round 2 of the layoffs, there were ten employees in this group. Their ages were 25, 33, 35, 38, 48, 53, 55, 55, 56, 64. Three were chosen for layoff: the two 55-year-olds (including Martin) and the 64-year old.</p>

  <note>
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Although we might suspect the distribution to be centered at zero, the graph is not expected to be symmetric because the group sizes are unequal and we subtracted laid-off – retained. Also, the data set is small so there will be <q>granularity</q> between the possible values for the difference. In fact, other possible choices of statistics (e.g., difference in medians) would look even <q>stranger.</q> But those details are less important, we can still use these values to determine a p-value.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    
    <p>In this analysis, you assumed a null hypothesis – the lay-offs are made completely at random – and you considered all 120 possible assignments of 7 people to be retained and 3 people to be laid off. (You could have flipped a coin for each employee, but that would lay off 50% in the long-run rather than fixing 3 to be laid off.) Of these 120 possible assignments, we want to know how many are <q>at least as extreme</q> as the observed result. If we focus on the outcomes where 3 of the 4 oldest people end up in the laid-off group, only the 55₁, 56, 64 and 55₂, 56, 64 combinations have a difference in means (17.33 years, which can happen two ways) larger than what we observed (16.86). The 55₁, 55₂, 56 combination and the 53, 56, 64 combination don't have quite as large a difference in means (13.04 and 16.38 respectively). So this finds an exact p-value = 3/120 = 0.025, which tells us that if these decisions had been made completely at random, there is a 2.5% chance we would see a combination of ages at least as extreme as the actual outcome as measured by the difference in group means. This is moderate evidence that the decision-making process was not at random. If you do find this evidence compelling, you must keep in mind the observational nature of the data; we cannot draw any cause-and-effect conclusions about the reasons for the non-random lay-off decisions.</p>

  <note>
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In the rest of this chapter, you will focus on comparing groups on a quantitative response variable. The reasoning process of statistical significance remains the same – how often would random chance give me a result at least as extreme? Your analysis will still focus on two key ideas: How were the groups formed (e.g., random assignment vs. random sampling), or are we modelling hypothetical randomness? And choice of statistic for comparing the two groups. With large sample sizes we won't be able to list out all the outcomes so we will focus more on simulation and mathematical models. The latter will also again allow us to use a convenient confidence interval formula. Once you have a p-value or confidence interval, you interpret them in the same way as in previous chapters, while also considering the limitations of the study design.</p>
