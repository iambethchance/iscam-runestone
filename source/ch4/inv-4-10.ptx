  <title>Investigation 4.10: Comparison Shopping</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>A student group at Cal Poly carried out a study to compare the prices at two different local grocery stores. The inventory list for Scolari's (a privately-owned local store) was broken into 32 sheets, each with 30 items. A number between 01 and 30 was randomly generated, 17, and the 17th item on each sheet was selected. Each student was then responsible for obtaining the price of that item at both Scolari's and Lucky's (which advertises itself as a discount grocery store). If the exact item was not available at both stores, the item was adjusted slightly (size or brand name) so that the identical item could be priced at both stores. Students gathered two prices for the 29 items that were found at both stores (two were found at Lucky's but not Scolari's). The data are available in shoppingData.txt.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>An important first step in data analysis is always to explore your data! With these data, we found some unusual observations and upon further investigation realized that one data value had been recorded in error (e.g., milk). In this case, we would be justified in removing this observation from the data file (we did not have any justification for removing the other outliers). After cleaning the data, we found that the price differences were slightly skewed to the left with a few outliers (flour, toothpaste, and frozen yogurt). The average price difference (Lucky's <m>-</m> Scolari's) was <m>-\$0.118</m>, with a standard deviation of <m>\$0.359</m>. The median price difference was <m>\$0</m>. So though the sample did not show a strong tendency for one store to have lower prices, the sample mean difference was in the conjectured direction. A one-sided paired <em>t</em>-test found that the mean price difference between these two stores was significantly less than 0 (<em>t</em>-value = <m>-1.74</m>, p-value = 0.046) at the 10% level of significance, and even (barely) at the 5% level. A 95% confidence interval contained zero (as the two-sided p-value would be larger than 0.05). A 90% confidence interval for the mean price difference was (<m>-0.234</m>, <m>-0.003</m>). We can be 90% confident that, on average, items at Scolari's cost between 0.3 cents and 23 cents more than items at Lucky's. This seems like a small savings but could become practically significant for a very large shopping trip. (Note, the average savings is not the same as the savings we would expect on an individual item.) In fact, we are 90% confident that an individual item will be anywhere from 74 cents more expensive at Scolari's to 50 cents more expensive at Lucky's. We feel comfortable generalizing these conclusions to the population of all products common to the two stores because the data were randomly selected using a probability method (systematic random sampling).</p>

      <statement>
        <p>If you feel the <em>t</em>-procedures are not likely to be valid, another approach is a sign test (e.g., <xref ref="inv-2-7">Investigation 2.7</xref>, Example 2.2). Remove all products that have zero price difference (the ties) and count how many products are more expensive at Scolari's vs. Lucky's. Is this significantly more than half? You can use a binomial test or one proportion <em>z</em>-test (if valid) to decide and/or a confidence interval to estimate the probability a product is more expensive at Scolari's (for all the products that do have a price difference).</p>
