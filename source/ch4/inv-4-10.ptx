  <title>Investigation 4.10: Comparison Shopping</title>

  <introduction>

      <stack>
        <p>A student group at Cal Poly carried out a study to compare the prices at two different local grocery stores. The inventory list for Scolari's (a privately-owned local store) was broken into 32 sheets, each with 30 items. A number between 01 and 30 was randomly generated, 17, and the 17th item on each sheet was selected. </p>

    </sidebyside>
<p>Each student was then responsible for obtaining the price of that item at both Scolari's and Lucky's (which advertises itself as a discount grocery store). If the exact item was not available at both stores, the item was adjusted slightly (size or brand name) so that the identical item could be priced at both stores. Students gathered two prices for the 29 items that were found at both stores (two were found at Lucky's but not Scolari's). The data are available in <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/data/shoppingData.txt" visual="rossmanchance.com/iscam3/data/shoppingData.txt"><c>shoppingData.txt</c></url>.</p>

      <p>Was this an experimental study or an observational study? Was this a simple random sample? Was it a probability sample? What is the advantage of this procedure over a simple random sample? Are there any disadvantages in selecting the sample this way?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>This was an observational study. This was not a SRS, but was a systematic sample. Advantage - very convenient and uses random selection; disadvantage - still have to find items.</p>

      <p>Yes, there is much less variability in the differences than in the prices themselves (we are comparing very different types of products with a wide range of prices).</p>

      <p>Would applying a paired <em>t</em>-test appear to be appropriate for these data? Explain.</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>Yes, the distribution of the differences is not heavily skewed, nor are there huge outliers, and our sample size is close to 30. Note, the distributions of the prices themselves are skewed to the right, but that doesn't concern us here as we focus on the distribution of the differences.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>What conclusions can you draw from this output? Be sure to address significance, causation, generalizability, and confidence.</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>p-value = 0.046, so we have strong evidence (at 5% level) that the average price difference is positive. That is, on average, Scolari's is more expensive per item. I'm 95% confident I will save 0.02 cents to $0.60 per item on average. Can generalize to all items at the two stores because systematic sampling used. But cannot draw a cause-and-effect conclusion as this is an observational study.</p>

      <p>90% prediction interval: <m>(-0.74, 0.50)</m></p>
      <p>I'm 90% confident that an individual item will be anywhere from 74 cents more expensive at Scolari's to 50 cents more expensive at Lucky's. (Meaning, this should work -- successfully predict a price difference -- 90% of the time. So we can say roughly 90% of products have a price difference in this interval, at least with 90% confidence.)</p>

    <title>Compare Interval Widths</title>
    <statement>
      <p>How does the width of this prediction interval in <xref ref="inv4-10-h">Checkpoint 8</xref> compare to the width of the confidence interval for the population mean price difference in <xref ref="inv4-10-g">Checkpoint 7</xref>? Explain why this makes sense.</p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>Which is harder to predict, the mean or the next observation?</p>
    </hint>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>The prediction interval is much wider than the confidence interval (but has the same midpoint). This reflects that it is harder to predict the outcome of the next observation than the average outcome of all the observations.</p>

    <title>Comparing Intervals</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Which interval, the prediction interval or the confidence interval, do you find more useful here? Explain.</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>It's important to realize that they tell us different things. Do you want to know the price difference averaged across the population (e.g., to help you figure out the total bill between the two stores on all items) or do you want to know how much the price different might be on an individual item?</p>
      <p><alert>Note:</alert> About 6 of the 28 items (21%) are inside the confidence interval. This proportion is not supposed to be close to 0.90 because the confidence interval provides an estimate of the population mean, not individual prices. With the prediction interval 25 of 28 items (89%) are inside the prediction interval.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>An important first step in data analysis is always to explore your data! With these data, we found some unusual observations and upon further investigation realized that one data value had been recorded in error (e.g., milk). In this case, we would be justified in removing this observation from the data file (we did not have any justification for removing the other outliers). After cleaning the data, we found that the price differences were slightly skewed to the left with a few outliers (flour, toothpaste, and frozen yogurt). The average price difference (Lucky's <m>-</m> Scolari's) was <m>-\$0.118</m>, with a standard deviation of <m>\$0.359</m>. The median price difference was <m>\$0</m>. So though the sample did not show a strong tendency for one store to have lower prices, the sample mean difference was in the conjectured direction. A one-sided paired <em>t</em>-test found that the mean price difference between these two stores was significantly less than 0 (<em>t</em>-value = <m>-1.74</m>, p-value = 0.046) at the 10% level of significance, and even (barely) at the 5% level. A 95% confidence interval contained zero (as the two-sided p-value would be larger than 0.05). A 90% confidence interval for the mean price difference was (<m>-0.234</m>, <m>-0.003</m>). We can be 90% confident that, on average, items at Scolari's cost between 0.3 cents and 23 cents more than items at Lucky's. This seems like a small savings but could become practically significant for a very large shopping trip. (Note, the average savings is not the same as the savings we would expect on an individual item.) In fact, we are 90% confident that an individual item will be anywhere from 74 cents more expensive at Scolari's to 50 cents more expensive at Lucky's. We feel comfortable generalizing these conclusions to the population of all products common to the two stores because the data were randomly selected using a probability method (systematic random sampling).</p>
