  <title>Investigation 4.3: Left-Handedness and Life Expectancy</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>Psychologist Stanley Coren has conducted several studies investigating the life expectancy of left-handers compared to right-handers, believing that the stress of being left-handed in a right-handed world leads to earlier deaths among the left-handers. In one study Coren and Halpern (<url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2006231/">1991</url>) sent surveys to thousands of next-of-kin of recently deceased southern Californians and asked whether the person had been right-handed or left-handed. They were very careful in how they collected their data. First, they consulted a bereavement counselor who suggested that they not contact anyone unless at least 9 months had passed since the death. The counselor also suggested that they make the contact as gentle as possible and not follow up or press people for responses. The researchers also decided that they would not contact next of kin if the death had been a result of murder or suicide or if the deceased was a child age 6 or younger. They received 987 replies and found that the average age of right-handed people at death was 75 years and for left-handed people it was 66 years.</p>

    <solution>
      <p>This is really a single random sample (among those willing to participate). Participants were then asked about their handedness (cross-classified) but because there is no connection between the left and right handers in this study, it is reasonable to consider them two independent random samples.</p>

  <p>Even though the researchers did not take a random sample of left-handers and a separate random sample of right-handers, we are still willing to consider these samples as independent because the results for one group should have no effect on the results for the other group. In a situation with two independent random samples, we can apply the two-sample <m>t</m>-test to make inferences about the difference in the population means.</p>

      <p>Need to know the sample sizes of the two individual groups as well as how much variability there is in the ages at death (sample standard deviations).</p>

      <p>When the sample size for the left handers is larger, we have more evidence against the null hypothesis (larger |t-statistics|, smaller p-values). When the sample standard deviations are larger, we have less evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Probably scenario 1 or 2 as they have more a more realistic percentage of left-handers and the sample standard deviations (15) are more reasonable (the others are too large if we are expecting about 32% of data values to fall more than one standard deviation above or below the mean. We probably aren't expecting a normal distribution, but these standard deviations still feel too large).</p>

    <title>Alternative Explanation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Part of the motivation for this research was an earlier study by Porac and Coren (1981) that surveyed 5147 men and women of all ages in North America. They found that 15% of ten-year-olds were left-handed, compared to only 5% of fifty-year-olds and less than 1% of eighty-year-olds. At the age of 85, right-handers outnumbered left-handers by a margin of 200 to 1. Suggest another explanation for these puzzling findings that actually provides a counter-argument to the conclusion from the 1991 Coren and Halpern study that left-handers tend to live shorter lives than right-handers.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>For those who would be in their eighties in 1981, many of them would have been encouraged to not be left-handed when they were younger. This would explain why there were fewer left-handers in the older age groups.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    
    <p>The difference in the sample mean lifetimes does appear to be statistically significant for all reasonable choices of the sample sizes and the sample standard deviations, so we have strong evidence that left-handers do tend to have shorter life spans than right-handers. However, there are numerous cautions to heed when drawing conclusions from such a study. This was a retrospective study with voluntary response, and in fact the researchers reported that they tended to hear from the left-handed relatives more often than right-handers, and they only heard from fewer than half of the families contacted. There is also no information given about the proportion of left-handers in the two southern California counties studied or the average ages of their residents now. In particular, one explanation for the lower percentage of left-handers among the elderly is not that they have died younger but that it used to be quite common practice to strongly encourage left-handed children to switch to being right-handed. Nowadays, that is less common (in fact many athletes love having this advantage!), and so now there is a higher percentage of left-handers among younger age groups. This helps to explain why the left-handers who had died would tend to be younger. In other words, maybe the average age difference between living left-handers and right-handers is also nine years.</p>
    
    <p>These studies have actually become hot topics for debate as some other studies have not been able to replicate Coren and Halpren's results. Other prospective longitudinal studies in the United States (Marks and Williams, 1991; Wolf, D'Agostino, and Cobb, 1991) have not found a significant difference in age at death. Still others have found connections between handedness and accident rates, lower birth rates, cancer, alcohol misuse, smoking, and schizophrenia. Alas, we don't see any randomized, comparative experiments being conducted to answer these questions in the near future!</p>
  </assemblage>
  
  <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> You should have found that larger variability in each sample (so a larger SE) produces a larger p-value and therefore less convincing evidence that the population means differ. Or to put this in a more positive light: Reducing variability within groups makes it easier to distinguish between the groups. You should also have found that a bigger discrepancy in sample sizes between the two groups produces a larger p-value and therefore less convincing evidence that the population means differ.</p>

One of the schools, chosen at random, incorporated an 18-lesson, 6-month classroom curriculum designed to reduce watching television and playing video games, whereas the other school made no changes to its curriculum.

        <p>(a) Do you think the researchers are happy or unhappy about the size of this p-value? The researchers are happy about the large p-value at baseline because it indicates there is no significant difference between the control and intervention groups at the start of the study, which is what they want.</p>
        <p>(b) Without performing any calculations, how should the p-value for these data compare (larger or smaller) to the p-value from the actual baseline results? The p-value would be smaller because the difference in means is larger (14.46 - 8.80 = 5.66 vs. 15.46 - 15.35 = 0.11).</p>
        <p>(c) Without performing any calculations, how should the p-value for these data compare (larger or smaller) to the actual baseline results? The p-value would be smaller because the smaller the value of σ (sample standard deviations), the smaller the p-value.</p>
        <p>(d) Advantage: By reducing the variability within groups (smaller SDs), it would be easier to detect a difference between groups at the conclusion. Disadvantage: By subsetting, the sample sizes would be smaller, making it harder to detect a difference.</p>
