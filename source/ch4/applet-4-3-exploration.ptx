    <title>First Guess</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Press the <term index="no">Draw New Samples</term> button to generate data from two populations. Based on the resulting data, enter a guess for the p-value for a two-sample <m>t</m>-test on these data and then press <term index="no">Check Guess</term>.</p>
      
      <p>How close was your guess? Were you surprised by the actual value? In what way? How might you guess differently the next time?</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Answers will vary.</p>

    <title>Second Guess</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Press the <term index="no">Draw New Samples</term> button, enter your guess for the value of the p-value for these data and press Enter. Describe how close you were and what adjustments you might make in your thinking.</p>
    </statement>

  <exercise xml:id="applet-4-3-c" label="AE4.3.3">
    <title>Practice with 10 Samples</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Repeat this process for a total of 10 pairs of samples (you do not need to record your results but you should try to learn from the reveal of the actual values as you make your guesses). Do you think your guessing ability improved by the last guess? Explain.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Answers will vary.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="applet-4-3-d" label="AE4.3.4">
    <title>Effect of Population Mean Difference</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Now check the <term index="no">Edit population parameters</term> box and press <term index="no">Draw New Samples</term>. Press <term index="no">Check Guess</term> and now use the slider to create a larger and larger difference between the two population means. How does this impact the p-value?</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>The greater the difference between the population means, the smaller the p-value.</p>
    </solution>

  <exercise xml:id="applet-4-3-e" label="AE4.3.5">
    <title>Effect of Population Standard Deviation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Now use the slider to create a larger/smaller (common) population standard deviation. How does this impact the p-value?</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>The smaller the value of σ, the smaller the p-value.</p>
    </solution>
    <response/>

  <exercise xml:id="applet-4-3-f" label="AE4.3.6">
    <title>Effect of Sample Sizes</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Use the applet to explore the impact of the sample sizes. Summarize what you learn.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>The larger and more similar the sample sizes, the smaller the p-value.</p>
