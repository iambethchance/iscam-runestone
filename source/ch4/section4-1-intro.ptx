  <title>Section 1: Comparing Groups – Quantitative Response</title>
  
  <p>In this chapter, we will focus on comparing two groups on a quantitative response variable. Again, the reasoning is still the same as in Ch. 1–3, but we will see some small changes in the details. We start with a small investigation to review key ideas and then we parallel Chapter 3 in first considering random sampling and then random assignment, both for scope of conclusions but also for how we will design our simulation.</p>
