  <title>Investigation 4.6: Ice Cream Serving Sizes</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>Researchers conducted a study in which they invited members of the Department of Food Science and Nutritional Science (faculty, graduate students, and staff) at a large midwestern university to an ice cream social (<url href="http://www.brianwansink.com/uploads/5/5/8/1/55817101/intro.___chapter_1_-_mindless_eating.pdf">Mindless Eating: Why we eat more than we think</url>, Wansink et al., 2006). The participants were randomly given either a 17- or a 34-ounce bowl. Participants individually helped themselves to the available ice cream in the cafeteria line, unaware that other participants had been given different-sized bowls. The suspicion was that even nutrition experts would tend to take more ice cream when given a larger bowl. Sample results for the actual volumes of ice cream taken (in ounces) are summarized in the following table:</p>

      <title>Two-Sample <em>t</em>-Test and Confidence Interval</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Use technology to carry out a two-sample <em>t</em>-test to determine whether individuals given a 34-oz bowl have a tendency to serve themselves more ice cream than individuals given a 17-oz bowl. Be sure to report your standardized statistic and p-value. Also determine a 95% <em>t</em>-confidence interval for the difference in the long-run average serving size. State conclusion that addresses the statistical significance of the data, the magnitude of the difference in the population, whether you are willing to draw a cause-and-effect conclusion, and the population to which you are willing to generalize the results.</p>

      <solution>
        <p>With a p-value = 0.027 &lt; 0.05, we would conclude that we do have convincing evidence that the larger bowl size causes (this was a randomized experiment) nutrition experts (not a random sample) to take larger servings of ice cream.</p>

        <p>This is consistent because the one-sided p-value was below 0.05 but the two-sided p-value was not. With a two-sided p-value above 0.05, we expect zero to be inside the 95% confidence interval.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>In this study, we find that the observed difference in the average serving size taken by nutrition experts using a 34-oz bowl is significantly larger than for those using the 17-oz bowl (p-value <m>\approx</m> 0.027). In fact, we can say that we are 95% confident that if we were to repeat these identical conditions indefinitely, those using the larger bowls would take on average up to 2.8555 more ounces of ice cream. However, the two-sided p-value is larger than 0.05, so our 95% CI does include zero, and it's plausible that those using the smaller bowls will take on average up to 0.0255 more ounces of ice cream in the long-run.</p>
