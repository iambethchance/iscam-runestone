  <title>Sec 2.1: Descriptive Statistics for Quantitative Data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, we will begin our exploration of numerical and graphical summaries when the variable is quantitative. You will learn a new set of tools, but keep in mind that the overall goal is to informatively summarize the data and to let the data tell their story. This chapter parallels Chapter 1 in many ways, but focuses on quantitative variables rather than categorical ones. This requires us to learn different tools for graphing and summarizing our data.</p>
