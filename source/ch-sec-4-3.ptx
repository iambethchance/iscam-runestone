  <title>Sec 4.3: Comparing Two Treatment Means</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The previous section focused on quantitative data arising from two independent random samples. This section will focus on quantitative data arising from randomized experiments. We will again consider simulation-based, exact, and theory-based p-values, as well as what assumptions we need to make for confidence intervals.</p>
