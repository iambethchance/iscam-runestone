      <title>To the Student</title>
      
      <p>Statistics is a mathematical science.</p>
      
      <p>Although this is a very short sentence, perhaps a self-evident one, and certainly one of the shortest that you will find in this book, we want to draw your attention to several things about it:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><p>We use the singular "is" and not the plural "are." It is certainly grammatically correct and more common usage to say "statistics are...", but that use of the term refers to statistics as numerical values. In this sentence we mean statistics as a field of study, one that has its own concepts and techniques, and one that can be exciting to study and practice.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use "mathematical" as an adjective. Statistics certainly makes use of much mathematics, but it is a separate discipline and not a branch of mathematics. Many, perhaps most, of the concepts and methods in statistics are mathematical in nature, but there are also many that do not involve mathematics. You will see an example of this early in the book as you study the difference between observational studies and controlled experiments. You will find that even in cases where the mathematical aspects of two situations may be identical, the scope of one's conclusions depends crucially on how the data were collected, a statistical rather than a mathematical consideration.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use the noun "science." Statistics is the science of gaining insight from data. Data are (notice the plural here) pieces of information (often but not always numerical) gathered on people or objects or processes. The science of statistics involves all aspects of inquiry about data. Well-designed studies begin with a research question or hypothesis, devise a plan for collecting data to address that issue, proceed to gather the data and analyze them, and then often make inferences about how the findings generalize beyond the particular group being studied. Statistics concerns itself with all phases of this process and therefore encompasses the scientific method.</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In these materials, our goal is to introduce you to this practice of statistics, to help you think about the applications of statistics and to study the mathematical underpinnings of the statistical methods. Most of all, we hope you will find fun and engaging examples. Statistics is a vitally important subject, and also fun to study and practice, largely because it brings you into contact with all kinds of interesting questions. You will analyze data from medical studies, legal cases, psychology experiments, sociological studies, and many other contexts. To paraphrase the late statistician John Tukey, "the best thing about statistics is that it allows you to play in everyone's backyard." You never know what you might learn in a statistics class!</p>
      
      <p>One of the first features you will notice about these materials is that you will play the active role of investigator. You will read about an actual study and consider the research question, and then we will lead you to discover and apply the appropriate tools for carrying out the analysis. A primary reason for the investigative nature of these materials is that we strongly believe that you will better understand and retain the concepts if you build your own knowledge and are engaged in the context. Be sure to also pay attention to the Study Conclusions to see how to effectively convey statistical information and to the Practice Problems for testing your understanding. Key terms are also hyperlinked (though some pdf viewers change the # to %23, so you need to change back or just go to the main glossary link).</p>
      
      <p>Though you will only scratch the surface of the statistical methods used in practice, you will learn fundamental concepts (such as variability, randomness, confidence, and significance) that are an integral part of many statistical analyses. A distinct emphasis will be the focus on how the data are collected and how this determines the scope of conclusions that you can draw from the data.</p>

        <title>Investigation A: Hurricanes and Climate Change</title>
        
      <p>One of the concerns with climate change is an increased number of tropical storms (including hurricanes and major hurricanes). In particular, in the "Atlantic Basin," scientists have tracked the number of "named storms" since 1851. According to the National Hurricane Center:</p>

      <p>In this investigation, you have just touched on one piece of information related to climate change. In fact, scientists are less concerned about the number of storms but in the intensity of the storms and how warming of the surface ocean may be leading to more destructive storms. Looking at a single year in isolation or even a pair of years creates a very incomplete picture of trends over time, and while we expect some natural variation from year-to-year, the question to scientists is whether the overall trend being observed is larger than what we can reasonably attributed to natural variation.</p>

        <title>Points to keep in mind</title>
        <ul>
          <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
          <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
          <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
          <li>The quality of your inferences will depend A LOT on the quality of the data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data or data from a completely different time period.</li>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>When exploring a research question, one of the first steps is to define the variable involved, e.g., the number of hurricanes. This is an example of <term>quantitative variables</term>, as opposed to a <term>categorical variable</term> like whether the storm has winds over 74 mph. Dotplots are good choices for visualizing a quantitative variable for a small dataset. When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Center</em>: What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
          <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
          <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
          <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To summarize the center of the distribution, we often report the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h><h>the average of all numerical values in the data set</h></idx> (the arithmetic average of all the numerical values in the data set) and/or the <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h><h>a value such that at least 50% of the observations in the data set are smaller than that value and at least 50% of the observations in the data set are larger than that value</h></idx> (a middle value such that 50% of the data values are smaller and 50% are larger).</p>
      </note>
      
      <p>With most investigations we will also provide a follow-up practice problem or two for you to try on your own to assess your understanding of the material.</p>

      <p>After the city submitted their data, the state instructed them to drop two of the values because they violated testing guidelines. One measurement was dropped because there was a water filter in the home – which could give an artificially low measurement – but actually this value was 104 ppb, the maximum by far. The other dropped value, 20 ppb, also on the high side, was dropped because it came from a business, not a home.</p>

      <p>A key skill in statistical analysis is communicating the results of your analysis to different audiences, including audiences with little experience with categorical or quantitative data. With each investigation in this text, we will present a Study Conclusions box as below as a model for an effective summary of the analysis of the research question, which often includes statements of new questions.</p>
      <note>
        <title>Study Conclusions</title>
        <p>For the sample of 71 home, we see that most of the observed lead concentrations (63/71 or 88.6%) are below 15 ppb, with a mean of 7.3 ppb and a median of 3.0 ppb. The mean is much larger than the median due to the shape of the distribution and the large outlier (104 ppb). In investigating the outlier, officials decided to drop it as the home used a water filter (though we would expect that to lower the lead concentration). Another (high) observation (20 ppb) came from a business. Removing those observations means 63/69 or 91.3% of the lead concentrations are below 15ppb, and 8.7% are above. The removal of these two observations impacts whether the criteria of at most 10% of homes above 15 ppb is met. Because of such irregularities, it would be appropriate for a new set of measurements to be taken by an independent group. It is also not clear why they only sampled 71 homes rather than the required 100. An expert on water treatment and the ACLU of Michigan obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and found that the city did not test "worst-case-scenario" homes known to either be serviced by lead service lines, or to have lead pipes in them. It does not seem ethical to use these data to conclude the water was safe.</p>
      </note>
      <p>After this test, many residents starting complaining that the tap water appeared brown and smelly, and not even suitable for bathing (<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis">wikipedia</url>). Eighteen months after the water supply was switched, the authorities admitted that the citizen scientists were right: contaminated water was poisoning Flint's residents. In October 2015, the city switched back to the old Detroit Water supply from Lake Huron and, a short while later, a state of emergency was declared. For more references:</p>

      <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> Statistical analysis often involves looking for patterns in data. In the age of the "data deluge," this is becoming increasingly important. This investigation should have raised your awareness of several key issues that will permeate the studies you analyze in this text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
        <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
        <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
        <li>The quality of your inferences (Is my sample result close to the population result?) will depend A LOT on the quality of the sample data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With most investigations we will also provide a follow-up practice problem or two for you to try on your own to assess your understanding of the material.</p>
