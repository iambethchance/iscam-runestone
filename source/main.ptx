      <title>To the Student</title>
      
      <p>Statistics is a mathematical science.</p>
      
      <p>Although this is a very short sentence, perhaps a self-evident one, and certainly one of the shortest that you will find in this book, we want to draw your attention to several things about it:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><p>We use the singular "is" and not the plural "are." It is certainly grammatically correct and more common usage to say "statistics are...", but that use of the term refers to statistics as numerical values. In this sentence we mean statistics as a field of study, one that has its own concepts and techniques, and one that can be exciting to study and practice.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use "mathematical" as an adjective. Statistics certainly makes use of much mathematics, but it is a separate discipline and not a branch of mathematics. Many, perhaps most, of the concepts and methods in statistics are mathematical in nature, but there are also many that do not involve mathematics. You will see an example of this early in the book as you study the difference between observational studies and controlled experiments. You will find that even in cases where the mathematical aspects of two situations may be identical, the scope of one's conclusions depends crucially on how the data were collected, a statistical rather than a mathematical consideration.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use the noun "science." Statistics is the science of gaining insight from data. Data are (notice the plural here) pieces of information (often but not always numerical) gathered on people or objects or processes. The science of statistics involves all aspects of inquiry about data. Well-designed studies begin with a research question or hypothesis, devise a plan for collecting data to address that issue, proceed to gather the data and analyze them, and then often make inferences about how the findings generalize beyond the particular group being studied. Statistics concerns itself with all phases of this process and therefore encompasses the scientific method.</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In these materials, our goal is to introduce you to this practice of statistics, to help you think about the applications of statistics and to study the mathematical underpinnings of the statistical methods. Most of all, we hope you will find fun and engaging examples. Statistics is a vitally important subject, and also fun to study and practice, largely because it brings you into contact with all kinds of interesting questions. You will analyze data from medical studies, legal cases, psychology experiments, sociological studies, and many other contexts. To paraphrase the late statistician John Tukey, "the best thing about statistics is that it allows you to play in everyone's backyard." You never know what you might learn in a statistics class!</p>
      
      <p>One of the first features you will notice about these materials is that you will play the active role of investigator. You will read about an actual study and consider the research question, and then we will lead you to discover and apply the appropriate tools for carrying out the analysis. A primary reason for the investigative nature of these materials is that we strongly believe that you will better understand and retain the concepts if you build your own knowledge and are engaged in the context. Be sure to also pay attention to the Study Conclusions to see how to effectively convey statistical information and to the Practice Problems for testing your understanding. Key terms are also hyperlinked (though some pdf viewers change the # to %23, so you need to change back or just go to the main glossary link).</p>
      
      <p>Though you will only scratch the surface of the statistical methods used in practice, you will learn fundamental concepts (such as variability, randomness, confidence, and significance) that are an integral part of many statistical analyses. A distinct emphasis will be the focus on how the data are collected and how this determines the scope of conclusions that you can draw from the data.</p>

      <title>Investigation A: Hurricanes and Climate Change</title>
      
      <p>One of the concerns with climate change is an increased number of tropical storms (including hurricanes and major hurricanes). In particular, in the "Atlantic Basin," scientists have tracked the number of "named storms" since 1851. 
      According to the <url href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/" target="_blank">National Hurricane Center</url>:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><term>Tropical Storm</term><idx><h>tropical storm</h><h>a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph</h></idx>: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph (34 to 63 knots).</li>

In the western North Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons; similar storms in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean are called cyclones.</li>
        <li><term>Major Hurricane</term><idx><h>major hurricane</h><h>a tropical cyclone with max sustained winds of 111 mph or higher</h></idx>: A tropical cyclone with max sustained winds of 111 mph (96 knots) or higher.</li>

      <p>Oftentimes a mean or average is reported, but with no measure of spread or variability. If all the years between 1991-2020 had between 6 and 8 hurricanes, we would react very differently to 14 hurricanes in one year than if all the years between 1991-2020 had between 2 and 15 hurricanes.</p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="def-standard-deviation">
        <title>Terminology Detour: Standard Deviation</title>
        <p>The most common measure of the variability in a distribution of data is the <term>standard deviation</term><idx><h>standard deviation</h><h>the square root of the variance; a measure of spread in the outcomes of a distribution; roughly the average deviation from the mean of the distribution</h></idx>.</p>

        <p>We can roughly interpret the standard deviation as the average "deviation" of the data values in the distribution from the mean of the distribution. Another interpretation: If we were to predict 7 as the number of hurricanes in a year between 1991-2020, the standard deviation would approximate the average "prediction error" for those years.</p>

      <p>In this investigation, you have just touched on one piece of information related to climate change. In fact, scientists are less concerned about the number of storms but in the intensity of the storms and how warming of the surface ocean may be leading to more destructive storms. Looking at a single year in isolation or even a pair of years creates a very incomplete picture of trends over time, and while we expect some natural variation from year-to-year, the question to scientists is whether the overall trend being observed is larger than what we can reasonably attributed to natural variation.</p>

        <title>Points to keep in mind</title>
        <ul>
          <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
          <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
          <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
          <li>The quality of your inferences will depend A LOT on the quality of the data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data or data from a completely different time period.</li>

      <paragraphs xml:id="discussion-a">
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>When exploring a research question, one of the first steps is to define the variable involved, e.g., the number of hurricanes. This is an example of <term>quantitative variables</term>, as opposed to a <term>categorical variable</term> like whether the storm has winds over 74 mph. Dotplots are good choices for visualizing a quantitative variable for a small dataset. When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Center</em>: What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
          <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
          <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
          <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To summarize the center of the distribution, we often report the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h><h>the average of all numerical values in the data set</h></idx> (the arithmetic average of all the numerical values in the data set) and/or the <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h><h>a value such that at least 50% of the observations in the data set are smaller than that value and at least 50% of the observations in the data set are larger than that value</h></idx> (a middle value such that 50% of the data values are smaller and 50% are larger).</p>

Our goal is to look for the pattern of outcomes from this process, with regard to the issue of how many mothers get the correct baby. This enables us to investigate the underlying properties of this child-returning process, such as the probability that at least one mother receives her own baby.</p>
      
      <exercise xml:id="random-babies-ex-a" label="B.1">
        <statement>
          <p>Before we proceed, what do you think is more likely to happen: that no mothers get the correct baby, or that all four mothers get the correct baby? Write down your initial guess and explain your reasoning.</p>

      <p>Because it is clearly not feasible to actually carry out this horrible child-returning process over and over again, we will instead <em>simulate</em> the random process to investigate what would happen in the long run. Suppose the four babies were named Murphy Miller, Wallis Williams, Bari Brown, and Shea Smith. Take four index cards and write the first name of each baby on a different card. Now take a sheet of paper and divide it into four regions, one for each mom. Next shuffle the index cards, face down, and randomly deal the babies back to the mothers. Flip the cards over and count the number of moms who received the correct baby.</p>

        <p>One disadvantage to using simulation to estimate a probability like this is that everyone will potentially obtain a different estimate. Even with a very large number of trials, your result will still only be an estimate of the actual long-run probability. For this particular scenario however, we can determine exact theoretical probabilities.</p>
        
        <p>First, let's list all possible outcomes for returning four babies to their mothers at random. We can organize our work by letting 1234 represent the outcome where the first baby went to the first mother, the second baby to the second mother, the third baby to the third mother, and the fourth baby to the fourth mother. In this scenario, all four mothers get the correct baby. As another example, 1243 means that the first two mothers get the right baby, but the third and fourth mothers have their babies switched.</p>

      <p>You could have determined the number of possible outcomes without having to list them first. For the first mother to receive a baby, she could receive any one of the four babies. Then there are three babies to choose from in giving a baby to the second mother. The third mother receives one of the two remaining babies and then the last baby goes to the fourth mother. Because the number of possibilities at one stage of this process does not depend on the outcome (which baby) of earlier stages, the total number of possibilities is the product <m>4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24</m>. This is also known as <m>4!</m>, read "4 factorial." Because the above outcomes are equally likely, the probability of any one of the above outcomes occurring is <m>1/24</m>.

      <title>Investigation 1.1: Friend or Foe?</title>
      
      <p>In a study reported in the November 2007 issue of <em>Nature</em>, researchers investigated whether infants take into account an individual's actions towards others in evaluating that individual as appealing or aversive, perhaps laying for the foundation for social interaction (Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom, 2007). In other words, do children who aren't even yet talking still form impressions as to someone's friendliness based on their actions? In one component of the study, sixteen 10-month-old infants were shown a <q>climber</q> character (a piece of wood with <q>googly</q> eyes glued onto it) that could not make it up a hill in two tries. Then the infants were shown two scenarios for the climber's next try, one where the climber was pushed to the top of the hill by another character (the <q>helper</q> toy) and one where the climber was pushed back down the hill by another character (the <q>hinderer</q> toy). The infant was alternately shown these two scenarios several times. Then the child was presented with both pieces of wood (the helper and the hinderer characters) and asked to pick one to play with.

        <title>Drawing Conclusions Beyond the Sample</title>
        
        <p>Clearly a majority/more than half of the infants chose the helper toy in this sample of 16 infants. But does that convince us that infants in general are more likely to pick the helper toy in the long run? In other words, what is the probability that an infant will choose the helper toy?</p>
        
        <p><em>Model assumption:</em> Note we are assuming each infant has the same probability of picking the helper toy, we just don't know the value of that probability.</p>
        
        <exercise xml:id="inv1-1-g" label="I1.1.7">
          <statement>
            <p>What do the researchers think is true about the value of this probability (e.g., do they think it is larger or smaller than 0.50)?</p>

        <exercise xml:id="inv1-1-h" label="I1.1.8">
          <statement>
            <p>Is it possible that in the long run infants just choose equally between the two toys (e.g., the probability an infant will choose the helper toy is 0.5) and we just happened to see more than half choose the helper toy in our sample?</p>

          <response/>
        </exercise>
        
        <p>So that leaves us with two explanations for the majority we observed:</p>
        <p><ol>
          <li><p>There is something to the theory that infants are genuinely more likely to pick the helper toy (for some reason).</p></li>
          <li><p>Infants choose equally between the two toys in the long run and we happened to get <q>lucky</q> and had an unusual sample where most of the infants in our sample picking the helper toy.</p></li>

          </statement>
          <response/>
        </exercise>
        
        <p>Our analysis approach is going to be to assume the second explanation is true (similar to how in a legal trial we assume a defendant is innocent), and then see whether our data are consistent or inconsistent with that assumption. To do this, we need to investigate the values we expect to see for the number choosing the helper toy when 16 infants are equally choosing between the two toys. As you saw with the Random Babies (Investigation B), we can simulate the outcomes of a random process to help us determine which outcomes are more or less likely to occur.</p>

        <p>For a 50-50 simulation model, we can flip a fair coin. We can arbitrarily define <q>heads</q> to be choosing the helper toy and <q>tails</q> to be choosing the hinderer toy. We will repeat the random process 16 times to represent the 16 infants, and we will count how many times we flip heads, representing an infant choosing the helper toy. The chart below shows this mapping of the real world, which we saw one instance of, and the simulation model, which we can easily repeat many times. Keep in mind that in the simulation model, we know the probability of heads is 0.50.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        
        <p>Returning to our legal trial analogy, if you decide that the observed <q>data</q> is unlikely to occur by chance alone, you are going to <q>reject</q> the assumption of <q>innocence</q> (and say we have evidence the defendant is guilty). If you decide the data/evidence is not unusual by chance alone, then you <q>fail to reject</q> that assumption (and we say we don't have evidence the defendant is guilty <mdash/> we aren't proving the defendant innocent, just that the evidence is not inconsistent with that assumption, <q>not guilty</q>).</p>
        
        <p>So based on these simulation results, we would say the data (14 helper choices out of 16 trials) is unusual under the assumption that infants genuinely have no preference and are choosing blindly when presenting the toys. This evidence convinces us that <q>There is something to the theory that infants are genuinely more likely to pick the helper toy (for some reason)</q> is the more believable explanation for why so many of the infants in this study picked the helper toy over the hinderer toy. We haven't proven this is true, but based on the strong majority these researchers saw, even for this small sample size of 16, we would consider the evidence convincing (<q>beyond a reasonable doubt</q>) that, in the long run, the probability of choosing the helper toy in this random process is greater than 0.5. Because the researchers controlled for other possible explanations for the observed preference results like color and handedness, we will conclude that there is convincing evidence that infants really do have a genuine preference for the helper toy over the hindering toy.</p>

        <title>Study Conclusions</title>
        
        <p>In a study of <q>social evaluation,</q> researchers explored whether pre-verbal infants have a preference for a <q>helping</q> toy over a <q>hindering</q> toy. Treating the 16 infants as identical observations from a random process with equal probability of success/failure, we find that getting 14 infants choosing the helper toy is not consistent with the types of values we expect to see when we have <q>infants</q> choosing equally between the two toys. This means that the researchers' data provide strong statistical evidence to reject this <q>no preference</q> model and conclude that the infants' choices are actually governed by a process where there is a genuine preference for the helper toy (or at least that it's more complicated than each infant flipping a coin to decide). Of course, this conclusion depends on the assumption of <q>identical infants</q> and that these 16 infants' choices are representative of the larger process of viewing the videos and selecting a toy. Also keep in mind that not all infants had a clear preference for either object.</p>

        <p>In a second experiment, the same events were repeated but the object climbing the hill no longer had the googly eyes attached. The researchers wanted to see whether the preference was made based on a social evaluation more than a perceptual preference. Suppose 8 of 12 (different) infants chose the push-up toy.</p>
