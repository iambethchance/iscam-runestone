      <p>Lead poisoning can be a serious problem associated with drinking tap water. Many older water pipes are made of lead. Over time, the pipes corrode, releasing lead into the drinking water. In April 2014, the city of Flint Michigan switched its water supply to the Flint River in an effort to save money. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) tested the water at the time and declared it safe to drink. Officials were supposed to test at least 100 homes, targeting those most at risk. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Lead and Copper Rule states that if lead concentrations exceed an action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb) in more than 10% of homes sampled, then actions must be undertaken to control corrosion, and the public must be informed.</p>

      <p>Often times we may have a larger group of interest, e.g., all homes that will be receiving this water, but we must use information from a subset of homes in order to make our decisions. This brings us to some key terminology.</p>

      <p>It is often not feasible to measure every member of the population (a census), and so we hope to use the sample to make inferences about the population.</p>
      <p>In presenting your results, you likely wouldn't list out each individual measurement; instead your goal is to summarize the overall behavior (or distribution) of the variable. How you do so will largely depend on the type of variable you have.</p>

      <p>It is often helpful to think of the variables as the questions posed to the observational units (e.g., what is the lead concentration, what type of housing). But not all questions are variables…</p>

      <p>To initially explore the distribution of a quantitative variable, we should start with a graph. The first thing to notice in the graph below (a <em>dotplot</em>) is that only 71 measurements were taken. We refer to this as the <em>sample size</em>, <m>n = 71</m>.</p>

      <!-- Learnosity iframe: https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/ISCAM_InvAj -->
      <p>When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Center</em>:  What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
        <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
        <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
        <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After the city submitted their data, the state instructed them to drop two of the values because they violated testing guidelines. One measurement was dropped because there was a water filter in the home – which could give an artificially low measurement – but actually this value was 104 ppb, the maximum by far. The other dropped value, 20 ppb, also on the high side, was dropped because it came from a business, not a home.</p>
      <!-- Learnosity iframe: https://coursekata.org/learnosity/preview/ISCAM_InvAo -->
      <p>The Lead and Copper Rule is actually not about the mean or median but about the 90th percentile (the value with 90% of the observations below it and 10% of the observations above it).</p>

      <p>A key skill in statistical analysis is communicating the results of your analysis to different audiences, including audiences with little experience with categorical or quantitative data. With each investigation in this text, we will present a Study Conclusions box as below as a model for an effective summary of the analysis of the research question, which often includes statements of new questions.</p>
      <note>
        <title>Study Conclusions</title>
        <p>For the sample of 71 home, we see that most of the observed lead concentrations (63/71 or 88.6%) are below 15 ppb, with a mean of 7.3 ppb and a median of 3.0 ppb. The mean is much larger than the median due to the shape of the distribution and the large outlier (104 ppb). In investigating the outlier, officials decided to drop it as the home used a water filter (though we would expect that to lower the lead concentration). Another (high) observation (20 ppb) came from a business. Removing those observations means 63/69 or 91.3% of the lead concentrations are below 15ppb, and 8.7% are above. The removal of these two observations impacts whether the criteria of at most 10% of homes above 15 ppb is met. Because of such irregularities, it would be appropriate for a new set of measurements to be taken by an independent group. It is also not clear why they only sampled 71 homes rather than the required 100. An expert on water treatment and the ACLU of Michigan obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and found that the city did not test "worst-case-scenario" homes known to either be serviced by lead service lines, or to have lead pipes in them. It does not seem ethical to use these data to conclude the water was safe.</p>
      </note>
      <p>After this test, many residents starting complaining that the tap water appeared brown and smelly, and not even suitable for bathing (<url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis">wikipedia</url>). Eighteen months after the water supply was switched, the authorities admitted that the citizen scientists were right: contaminated water was poisoning Flint's residents. In October 2015, the city switched back to the old Detroit Water supply from Lake Huron and, a short while later, a state of emergency was declared. For more references:</p>

      <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> Statistical analysis often involves looking for patterns in data. In the age of the "data deluge," this is becoming increasingly important. This investigation should have raised your awareness of several key issues that will permeate the studies you analyze in this text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
        <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
        <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
        <li>The quality of your inferences (Is my sample result close to the population result?) will depend A LOT on the quality of the sample data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With most investigations we will also provide a follow-up practice problem or two for you to try on your own to assess your understanding of the material.</p>
      <subsection xml:id="practiceA">
        <title>Practice Problem A.A</title>
        <p>We will typically use technology to create graphs and "summary statistics" of our variables. From the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/files.html">ISCAM data files and applets page</url> (Chapter 0), you can view the data in flint_mdeq.txt. Use your mouse to copy and paste these data to your clipboard. Now open the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/descstats/Dotplot.htm">Descriptive Statistics</url> applet. Clear the existing data (press <em>Clear</em>), click in the Paste data box and paste the data from your clipboard. Press the <em>Use Data</em> button. [Alternatively, this dataset is listed in the Select data pull-down menu as Flint water.]</p>
        <ol>
          <li>(a) Check the <em>Actual</em> boxes for the Mean, Median, and Std dev. Explain why the mean is so much larger than the median.</li>
          <li>(b) Use your mouse to click on and highlight the largest observation in the dotplot. Press the <em>Delete</em> button and report the new values for the Mean, Median, and Std dev. Did they change as expected?</li>
          <li>(c) Select the <em>Guess</em> box for the Median. This gives you a movable line. Check the <em>Show Percentages</em> box. How many observations are below 15ppm? What value would you report for the 90th percentile of this distribution?</li>
          <li>(d) Suppose instead we were only interested in one person's home and we took multiple measurements at that home. Would you expect all the measurements at that home to be the same? What could be some explanations for why they differ? What would you consider the "observational unit" and the "population" in this case?</li>
          <li>(e) Do you think the standard deviation of multiple measurements for that one home would be larger or smaller than the standard deviation of measurements across 71 homes? Explain your reasoning.</li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>
      <subsection xml:id="practiceB">
        <title>Practice Problem A.B</title>
        <p>Consider the following research questions. Identify the underlying observational units and variable(s). Classify the variables as quantitative or categorical.</p>

          <li>(a) Do CEOs of Fortune 500 companies tend to be taller than non-CEOs?</li>
          <li>(b) Do more teens have hearing loss now than teens ten years ago?</li>
