      <title>To the Student</title>
      
      <p>Statistics is a mathematical science.</p>
      
      <p>Although this is a very short sentence, perhaps a self-evident one, and certainly one of the shortest that you will find in this book, we want to draw your attention to several things about it:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><p>We use the singular "is" and not the plural "are." It is certainly grammatically correct and more common usage to say "statistics are...", but that use of the term refers to statistics as numerical values. In this sentence we mean statistics as a field of study, one that has its own concepts and techniques, and one that can be exciting to study and practice.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use "mathematical" as an adjective. Statistics certainly makes use of much mathematics, but it is a separate discipline and not a branch of mathematics. Many, perhaps most, of the concepts and methods in statistics are mathematical in nature, but there are also many that do not involve mathematics. You will see an example of this early in the book as you study the difference between observational studies and controlled experiments. You will find that even in cases where the mathematical aspects of two situations may be identical, the scope of one's conclusions depends crucially on how the data were collected, a statistical rather than a mathematical consideration.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use the noun "science." Statistics is the science of gaining insight from data. Data are (notice the plural here) pieces of information (often but not always numerical) gathered on people or objects or processes. The science of statistics involves all aspects of inquiry about data. Well-designed studies begin with a research question or hypothesis, devise a plan for collecting data to address that issue, proceed to gather the data and analyze them, and then often make inferences about how the findings generalize beyond the particular group being studied. Statistics concerns itself with all phases of this process and therefore encompasses the scientific method.</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In these materials, our goal is to introduce you to this practice of statistics, to help you think about the applications of statistics and to study the mathematical underpinnings of the statistical methods. Most of all, we hope you will find fun and engaging examples. Statistics is a vitally important subject, and also fun to study and practice, largely because it brings you into contact with all kinds of interesting questions. You will analyze data from medical studies, legal cases, psychology experiments, sociological studies, and many other contexts. To paraphrase the late statistician John Tukey, "the best thing about statistics is that it allows you to play in everyone's backyard." You never know what you might learn in a statistics class!</p>
      
      <p>One of the first features you will notice about these materials is that you will play the active role of investigator. You will read about an actual study and consider the research question, and then we will lead you to discover and apply the appropriate tools for carrying out the analysis. A primary reason for the investigative nature of these materials is that we strongly believe that you will better understand and retain the concepts if you build your own knowledge and are engaged in the context. Be sure to also pay attention to the Study Conclusions to see how to effectively convey statistical information and to the Practice Problems for testing your understanding. Key terms are also hyperlinked (though some pdf viewers change the # to %23, so you need to change back or just go to the main glossary link).</p>
      
      <p>Though you will only scratch the surface of the statistical methods used in practice, you will learn fundamental concepts (such as variability, randomness, confidence, and significance) that are an integral part of many statistical analyses. A distinct emphasis will be the focus on how the data are collected and how this determines the scope of conclusions that you can draw from the data.</p>

      <title>Investigation A: Hurricanes and Climate Change</title>
      
      <p>One of the concerns with climate change is an increased number of tropical storms (including hurricanes and major hurricanes). In particular, in the "Atlantic Basin," scientists have tracked the number of "named storms" since 1851. 
      According to the <url href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/" target="_blank">National Hurricane Center</url>:</p>

      <p>Oftentimes a mean or average is reported, but with no measure of spread or variability. If all the years between 1991-2020 had between 6 and 8 hurricanes, we would react very differently to 14 hurricanes in one year than if all the years between 1991-2020 had between 2 and 15 hurricanes.</p>

      <p>In this investigation, you have just touched on one piece of information related to climate change. In fact, scientists are less concerned about the number of storms but in the intensity of the storms and how warming of the surface ocean may be leading to more destructive storms. Looking at a single year in isolation or even a pair of years creates a very incomplete picture of trends over time, and while we expect some natural variation from year-to-year, the question to scientists is whether the overall trend being observed is larger than what we can reasonably attributed to natural variation.</p>

        <title>Points to keep in mind</title>
        <ul>
          <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
          <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
          <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
          <li>The quality of your inferences will depend A LOT on the quality of the data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data or data from a completely different time period.</li>

      <paragraphs xml:id="discussion-a">
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>When exploring a research question, one of the first steps is to define the variable involved, e.g., the number of hurricanes. This is an example of <term>quantitative variables</term>, as opposed to a <term>categorical variable</term> like whether the storm has winds over 74 mph. Dotplots are good choices for visualizing a quantitative variable for a small dataset. When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Center</em>: What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
          <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
          <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
          <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To summarize the center of the distribution, we often report the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h><h>the average of all numerical values in the data set</h></idx> (the arithmetic average of all the numerical values in the data set) and/or the <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h><h>a value such that at least 50% of the observations in the data set are smaller than that value and at least 50% of the observations in the data set are larger than that value</h></idx> (a middle value such that 50% of the data values are smaller and 50% are larger).</p>
