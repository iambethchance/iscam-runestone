      <title>To the Student</title>
      
      <p>Statistics is a mathematical science.</p>
      
      <p>Although this is a very short sentence, perhaps a self-evident one, and certainly one of the shortest that you will find in this book, we want to draw your attention to several things about it:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><p>We use the singular "is" and not the plural "are." It is certainly grammatically correct and more common usage to say "statistics are...", but that use of the term refers to statistics as numerical values. In this sentence we mean statistics as a field of study, one that has its own concepts and techniques, and one that can be exciting to study and practice.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use "mathematical" as an adjective. Statistics certainly makes use of much mathematics, but it is a separate discipline and not a branch of mathematics. Many, perhaps most, of the concepts and methods in statistics are mathematical in nature, but there are also many that do not involve mathematics. You will see an example of this early in the book as you study the difference between observational studies and controlled experiments. You will find that even in cases where the mathematical aspects of two situations may be identical, the scope of one's conclusions depends crucially on how the data were collected, a statistical rather than a mathematical consideration.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>We use the noun "science." Statistics is the science of gaining insight from data. Data are (notice the plural here) pieces of information (often but not always numerical) gathered on people or objects or processes. The science of statistics involves all aspects of inquiry about data. Well-designed studies begin with a research question or hypothesis, devise a plan for collecting data to address that issue, proceed to gather the data and analyze them, and then often make inferences about how the findings generalize beyond the particular group being studied. Statistics concerns itself with all phases of this process and therefore encompasses the scientific method.</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In these materials, our goal is to introduce you to this practice of statistics, to help you think about the applications of statistics and to study the mathematical underpinnings of the statistical methods. Most of all, we hope you will find fun and engaging examples. Statistics is a vitally important subject, and also fun to study and practice, largely because it brings you into contact with all kinds of interesting questions. You will analyze data from medical studies, legal cases, psychology experiments, sociological studies, and many other contexts. To paraphrase the late statistician John Tukey, "the best thing about statistics is that it allows you to play in everyone's backyard." You never know what you might learn in a statistics class!</p>
      
      <p>One of the first features you will notice about these materials is that you will play the active role of investigator. You will read about an actual study and consider the research question, and then we will lead you to discover and apply the appropriate tools for carrying out the analysis. A primary reason for the investigative nature of these materials is that we strongly believe that you will better understand and retain the concepts if you build your own knowledge and are engaged in the context. Be sure to also pay attention to the Study Conclusions to see how to effectively convey statistical information and to the Practice Problems for testing your understanding. Key terms are also hyperlinked (though some pdf viewers change the # to %23, so you need to change back or just go to the main glossary link).</p>
      
      <p>Though you will only scratch the surface of the statistical methods used in practice, you will learn fundamental concepts (such as variability, randomness, confidence, and significance) that are an integral part of many statistical analyses. A distinct emphasis will be the focus on how the data are collected and how this determines the scope of conclusions that you can draw from the data.</p>

      <title>Investigation A: Hurricanes and Climate Change</title>
      
      <p>One of the concerns with climate change is an increased number of tropical storms (including hurricanes and major hurricanes). In particular, in the "Atlantic Basin," scientists have tracked the number of "named storms" since 1851. 
      According to the <url href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/" target="_blank">National Hurricane Center</url>:</p>

        <statement>
          <p>Does this convince you that climate change is leading to an increase in the number of hurricanes (in the Atlantic)? If so, explain why. If not, explain what additional information you would want to know.</p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>Consider: Is comparing just two years enough evidence? What about natural year-to-year variation?</p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>Just because one year saw a large increase doesn't necessarily reflect an increasing trend. It's also hard to know whether this is a "large" increase when we don't have information on how much this value tends to vary from year to year. We can't draw any causal conclusions because other things could have changed in that time frame. We also need to keep in mind that "number of hurricanes" is just one possible reflection of "climate change."</p>

        <title>Assess Reported Mean</title>
        <statement>
          <p>The stormfax website reports the mean number of hurricanes between 1991-2020 to be 7. Does that appear consistent with the graph? Why do you think they chose that subset of years?</p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>Consider what's special about the 1991-2020 period. Is it the most recent data? Why might recent data be more relevant?</p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>This is consistent with the time plot. If we were to put a horizontal line at a height that goes through the middle of the values, 7 appears a reasonable value for that height. Perhaps they wanted to look at more recent data for more direct comparison with current data (opinions may vary).</p>

      </exercise>
      
      <p>Oftentimes a mean or average is reported, but with no measure of spread or variability. If all the years between 1991-2020 had between 6 and 8 hurricanes, we would react very differently to 14 hurricanes in one year than if all the years between 1991-2020 had between 2 and 15 hurricanes.</p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="def-standard-deviation">
        <title>Terminology Detour: Standard Deviation</title>
        <p>The most common measure of the variability in a distribution of data is the <term>standard deviation</term><idx><h>standard deviation</h><h>the square root of the variance; a measure of spread in the outcomes of a distribution; roughly the average deviation from the mean of the distribution</h></idx>.</p>
        <p><me>s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}}</me></p>
        <p>We can roughly interpret the standard deviation as the average "deviation" of the data values in the distribution from the mean of the distribution. Another interpretation: If we were to predict 7 as the number of hurricanes in a year between 1991-2020, the standard deviation would approximate the average "prediction error" for those years.</p>

      <p>In this investigation, you have just touched on one piece of information related to climate change. In fact, scientists are less concerned about the number of storms but in the intensity of the storms and how warming of the surface ocean may be leading to more destructive storms. Looking at a single year in isolation or even a pair of years creates a very incomplete picture of trends over time, and while we expect some natural variation from year-to-year, the question to scientists is whether the overall trend being observed is larger than what we can reasonably attributed to natural variation.</p>

        <title>Points to keep in mind</title>
        <ul>
          <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
          <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
          <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
          <li>The quality of your inferences will depend A LOT on the quality of the data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data or data from a completely different time period.</li>

      <paragraphs xml:id="discussion-a">
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>When exploring a research question, one of the first steps is to define the variable involved, e.g., the number of hurricanes. This is an example of <term>quantitative variables</term>, as opposed to a <term>categorical variable</term> like whether the storm has winds over 74 mph. Dotplots are good choices for visualizing a quantitative variable for a small dataset. When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Center</em>: What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
          <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
          <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
          <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To summarize the center of the distribution, we often report the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h><h>the average of all numerical values in the data set</h></idx> (the arithmetic average of all the numerical values in the data set) and/or the <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h><h>a value such that at least 50% of the observations in the data set are smaller than that value and at least 50% of the observations in the data set are larger than that value</h></idx> (a middle value such that 50% of the data values are smaller and 50% are larger).</p>

      <title>Investigation B: Random Babies</title>
      
      <p>In the previous investigation, you looked at historical data for a subset of homes from a larger population. In this investigation, the goal is to explore a <em>random</em> process. We apologize in advance for the absurd but memorable process below. Other examples of a random process are coin flipping or lead measurements taken at different times from the same house.</p>
      
      <p>Suppose that on one night at a certain hospital, four mothers give birth to four babies. As a very sick joke, the hospital staff decides to return babies to their mothers completely at random. Our goal is to look for the pattern of outcomes from this process, with regard to the issue of how many mothers get the correct baby. This enables us to investigate the underlying properties of this child-returning process, such as the probability that at least one mother receives her own baby.</p>
      
      <exercise xml:id="random-babies-ex-a" label="B.1">
        <title>Initial Prediction</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Before we proceed, what do you think is more likely to happen: that no mothers get the correct baby, or that all four mothers get the correct baby? Write down your initial guess and explain your reasoning.</p>
        </statement>
        <response/>
      </exercise>
      
      <p>Because it is clearly not feasible to actually carry out this horrible child-returning process over and over again, we will instead <em>simulate</em> the random process to investigate what would happen in the long run. Suppose the four babies were named Murphy Miller, Wallis Williams, Bari Brown, and Shea Smith. Take four index cards and write the first name of each baby on a different card. Now take a sheet of paper and divide it into four regions, one for each mom. Next shuffle the index cards, face down, and randomly deal the babies back to the mothers. Flip the cards over and count the number of moms who received the correct baby.</p>
      
      <p>Carry out this physical simulation at least 5 times and record your results.</p>

        <p>One disadvantage to using simulation to estimate a probability like this is that everyone will potentially obtain a different estimate. Even with a very large number of trials, your result will still only be an estimate of the actual long-run probability. For this particular scenario however, we can determine exact theoretical probabilities.</p>
        
        <p>First, let's list all possible outcomes for returning four babies to their mothers at random. We can organize our work by letting 1234 represent the outcome where the first baby went to the first mother, the second baby to the second mother, the third baby to the third mother, and the fourth baby to the fourth mother. In this scenario, all four mothers get the correct baby. As another example, 1243 means that the first two mothers get the right baby, but the third and fourth mothers have their babies switched.</p>

      <p>You could have determined the number of possible outcomes without having to list them first. For the first mother to receive a baby, she could receive any one of the four babies. Then there are three babies to choose from in giving a baby to the second mother. The third mother receives one of the two remaining babies and then the last baby goes to the fourth mother. Because the number of possibilities at one stage of this process does not depend on the outcome (which baby) of earlier stages, the total number of possibilities is the product <m>4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24</m>. This is also known as <m>4!</m>, read "4 factorial." Because the above outcomes are equally likely, the probability of any one of the above outcomes occurring is <m>1/24</m>.

          <p>Remember that expected value is a long-run average, not a prediction for a single trial.</p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>The expected value of 1 means that in the long run, on average, 1 mother will receive the correct baby per trial. This does NOT mean that in any single trial we expect exactly 1 match - in fact, we could get 0, 1, 2, or 4 matches. The expected value is the average across many trials.</p>

      <p>But from the results we saw above, each term <m>(\#)/1000</m> converges to the probability of that outcome as we increase the number of repetitions, giving us the above formula for <m>E(X)</m>. So we will interpret the expected value as the long-run mean of the outcomes.</p>

      <title>Investigation 1.1: Friend or Foe?</title>
      
      <introduction>
        <p>In a study reported in the November 2007 issue of <em>Nature</em>, researchers investigated whether infants take into account an individual's actions towards others in evaluating that individual as appealing or aversive, perhaps laying the foundation for social interaction (<url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18033298/">Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom, 2007</url>). In other words, do children who aren't even yet talking still form impressions as to someone's friendliness based on their actions?</p>
        
            <p>In one component of the study, sixteen 10-month-old infants were shown a <q>climber</q> character (a piece of wood with <q>googly</q> eyes glued onto it) that could not make it up a hill in two tries.</p>

            <p>Then the infants were shown two scenarios for the climber's next try, one where the climber was pushed to the top of the hill by another character (the <q>helper</q> toy) and one where the climber was pushed back down the hill by another character (the <q>hinderer</q> toy). The infant was alternately shown these two scenarios several times.</p>

        <title>Drawing Conclusions Beyond the Sample</title>
        
        <p>Clearly a majority/more than half of the infants chose the helper toy in this sample of 16 infants. But does that convince us that infants in general are more likely to pick the helper toy in the long run? In other words, what is the probability that an infant will choose the helper toy?</p>
        
        <p><em>Model assumption:</em> Note we are assuming each infant has the same probability of picking the helper toy, we just don't know the value of that probability.</p>

                <p>Correct! The researchers hypothesize that infants prefer the helper toy, which would mean the probability of choosing the helper is greater than 0.50.</p>

            <p>So for the two possibilities we are still considering, how might you choose between them? In particular, how might you convince someone whether or not option (2) is plausible based on this study?</p>

        <p>Our analysis approach is going to be to assume the second explanation is true (similar to how in a legal trial we assume a defendant is innocent), and then see whether our data are consistent or inconsistent with that assumption. To do this, we need to investigate the values we expect to see for the number choosing the helper toy when 16 infants are equally choosing between the two toys. As you saw with the Random Babies (Investigation B), we can simulate the outcomes of a random process to help us determine which outcomes are more or less likely to occur.</p>

This makes the two choices equally likely on each toss. Then use 16 coins or toss one coin 16 times to represent the 16 infants. (We are assuming these are equivalent, that the observational units are identical.) These results will help us assess the variability in the outcomes of 16 infants "just by chance." This will help us decide whether 14 is a typical outcome or an unusual outcome when we know for a fact that the "infants" choose equally (in the long run) between the two toys.</p>

        <p>For a 50-50 simulation model, we can flip a fair coin. We can arbitrarily define <q>heads</q> to be choosing the helper toy and <q>tails</q> to be choosing the hinderer toy. We will repeat the random process 16 times to represent the 16 infants, and we will count how many times we flip heads, representing an infant choosing the helper toy. The chart below shows this mapping of the real world, which we saw one instance of, and the simulation model, which we can easily repeat many times. Keep in mind that in the simulation model, we know the probability of heads is 0.50.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        
        <p>Returning to our legal trial analogy, if you decide that the observed <q>data</q> is unlikely to occur by chance alone, you are going to <q>reject</q> the assumption of <q>innocence</q> (and say we have evidence the defendant is guilty). If you decide the data/evidence is not unusual by chance alone, then you <q>fail to reject</q> that assumption (and we say we don't have evidence the defendant is guilty <mdash/> we aren't proving the defendant innocent, just that the evidence is not inconsistent with that assumption, <q>not guilty</q>).</p>
        
        <p>So based on these simulation results, we would say the data (14 helper choices out of 16 trials) is unusual under the assumption that infants genuinely have no preference and are choosing blindly when presenting the toys. This evidence convinces us that <q>There is something to the theory that infants are genuinely more likely to pick the helper toy (for some reason)</q> is the more believable explanation for why so many of the infants in this study picked the helper toy over the hinderer toy. We haven't proven this is true, but based on the strong majority these researchers saw, even for this small sample size of 16, we would consider the evidence convincing (<q>beyond a reasonable doubt</q>) that, in the long run, the probability of choosing the helper toy in this random process is greater than 0.5. Because the researchers controlled for other possible explanations for the observed preference results like color and handedness, we will conclude that there is convincing evidence that infants really do have a genuine preference for the helper toy over the hindering toy.</p>

        <title>Study Conclusions</title>
        
        <p>In a study of <q>social evaluation,</q> researchers explored whether pre-verbal infants have a preference for a <q>helping</q> toy over a <q>hindering</q> toy. Treating the 16 infants as identical observations from a random process with equal probability of success/failure, we find that getting 14 infants choosing the helper toy is not consistent with the types of values we expect to see when we have <q>infants</q> choosing equally between the two toys. This means that the researchers' data provide strong statistical evidence to reject this <q>no preference</q> model and conclude that the infants' choices are actually governed by a process where there is a genuine preference for the helper toy (or at least that it's more complicated than each infant flipping a coin to decide). Of course, this conclusion depends on the assumption of <q>identical infants</q> and that these 16 infants' choices are representative of the larger process of viewing the videos and selecting a toy. Also keep in mind that not all infants had a clear preference for either object.</p>

        <title>Measuring "Rareness"</title>
        
        <p>In Investigation 1.1, the observed result (14) was pretty far in the tail of the distribution and you probably agreed that we could consider it unusual. This result (6 out of 8) is not as inconsistent with the null hypothesis; so where do we "draw the line"? First, we need agree on a measure of "rareness." We could just calculate the theoretical probability of 6 heads in 8 tosses (0.1094), but keep in mind that if we have a larger sample size (e.g., 100 tosses), then any individual outcome (e.g., 62 heads) will have a small probability. So we want to judge how extreme our observation is relative to the other observations in the simulated distribution. One way to do this is to count how many outcomes are as or even more extreme (even further from the expected value) than the observed outcome. For example, if we tell you that only 1% of rattlesnakes are longer than 2.5 meters, then you know to be very surprised to see a 3-meter rattlesnake and you may even begin to think that what you are looking at is not a rattlesnake at all!</p>

      <title>Investigation 1.3: Are You Clairvoyant?</title>
      
      <introduction>
        <p>A standard test for extra-sensory perception (ESP) asks subjects to identify which of five symbols (e.g., circle, plus, square, diamond, waves) is on the front of a card, viewed by the experimenter but not the subject. The experimenter concentrates on the symbol and a <q>hit</q> is when the subject correctly identifies the symbol being viewed by the experimenter. The subject is given several trials, with the viewed symbol randomly determined for each of the trials, with no discernible pattern.</p>

        <title>Terminology Detour: Statistic vs. Parameter</title>
        
        <p>In analyzing data, it is important to differentiate between a <term>statistic</term> and the <term>parameter</term>. The observed statistic is a (known) numerical value that summarizes the observed results, whereas the parameter is the same numerical summary but applied to the underlying random process that generated the data. The value of the statistic is what we observe in the study, whereas the value of the parameter is rarely known.</p>
        
        <p>In Investigation 1.1, the statistic could be either the number (14) or the proportion (0.875) of infants who chose the helper toy. The parameter would then be the long-run probability of an infant picking the helper toy. In the case of a binomial random variable, we will use the symbol <m>\pi</m> (lower case Greek letter for <q>p</q>) to represent this unknown process probability.</p>

              <p>It is not a coincidence that the value of 9 appears in both and is close to the expected value + 2 SD.

              <p>Suppose you changed the test to use only 4 symbols. Does this change the expected number or standard deviation for the number of hits when a subject is guessing? How many would someone need to identify correctly to convince you they could perform better than guessing in the long-run?</p>
            </statement>
            <response/>
            <hint>
              <p>With 4 symbols, the probability of guessing correctly changes to 1/4 = 0.25. Recalculate the expected value and SD using this new probability, then find how many hits would be 2 SD above the mean.</p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
              <p>This would increase the probability of a correct guess to 0.25, and so the probability model would need to change as well. If there are only 4 cards, the probability of a correct guess increases to 0.25. So, with 25 attempts, the expected value would be <m>25(0.25) = 6.25</m> with an SD of <m>\sqrt{25(0.25)(0.75)} = 2.17</m>. So <m>6.25 + 2(2.17) = 10.59 \approx 11</m>. Notice that this <q>cutoff</q> value went up (10 or 11 vs. 9). This is because guessing is more likely to do well so we need more evidence that someone is not guessing. Also, using the applet, <m>P(C \geq 10) = 0.097</m> and <m>P(C \geq 11) = 0.044</m>.</p>

        <title>Summary</title>
        
        <p>The number of correct answers in 25 attempts, for someone who is guessing, can be modeled with a binomial distribution (assuming the probability of a correct answer is 0.20 each time and there is no pattern from attempt to attempt). In this case, the hypothesized value for the probability of <q>success</q> will be 0.20 rather than 0.5 due to the five cards to choose from, which we could model with spinners rather than coin tosses. If someone is simply guessing, in the long run they will guess correctly by chance alone 20% of the time. This means that if we give someone 25 attempts, we expect them to answer correctly <m>0.20 \times 25 = 5</m> times (on average, in the long run), with a standard deviation of <m>\sqrt{25(0.20)(0.80)} = 2</m> hits in 25 attempts. Keep in mind that the <q>statistical significance</q> of an outcome will depend on both the mean and the standard deviation of the null distribution. In this case, someone would need 9 or more hits to be more than 2 standard deviations above the mean, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.048. (It is not a coincidence that the 0.05 cut-off gives very similar results to the 2SD cut-off.)</p>

      <p>Poloneicki, Sismanidis, Bland, and Jones (<url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14751918/">2004</url>) reported that in September 2000 heart transplantation at St. George's Hospital in London was suspended because of concern that more patients were dying than previously. Newspapers reported that the 80% mortality rate in the last 10 cases was of particular concern because it was over five times the national average. The variable measured was whether or not the patient died within 30 days of the transplant. Although there was not an officially reported national mortality rate (probability of death within 30 days for patients undergoing this procedure), the researchers determined that 15% was a reasonable benchmark for comparison.</p>

        <title>Study Conclusions</title>
        <p>A sample mortality rate of 80% is indeed quite surprising, even with a sample size as small as 10, if the actual probability of death were 0.15. The (exact) p-value is 0.0000087, and the observed statistic is 5.76 standard deviations above the expected value, providing extremely strong evidence that the actual probability of death at this hospital is higher than the national benchmark of 0.15 (fewer than 1 in 100,000 sets of 10 operations would "randomly" have 8 or more deaths if <m>\pi = 0.15</m>). However, we must be cautious about doing this type of "data snooping," where we allowed a seemingly unusual observation to motivate our suspicion and then use the same data to support our suspicion. Once the initial suspicion has formed, we should collect new data on which to test the suspicion. The actual investigation examined all previous heart transplantations at this hospital over the previous 14 years. In this broader study, the p-value is 0.0097 and the observed number of successes is 2.48 standard deviations above the expected number, still providing very strong evidence against the null hypothesis. That is, there is strong evidence that this hospital's probability of mortality was higher than the 15% national benchmark. We must, however, be cautious because our study has not identified what factors could be leading to the higher rate. Perhaps this hospital tends to see sicker patients to begin with. The researchers actually performed a more sophisticated analysis that incorporated information about the risk factors of all the operations at this hospital and reached similar conclusions.</p>

The U.S. government sued the City of Hazelwood, a suburb of St. Louis, MO, on the grounds that it discriminated against African Americans in its hiring of school teachers. The evidence introduced noted that of the 405 teachers hired in 1972 and 1973 (the years following the passage of the Civil Rights Act), only 15 had been African-American. By comparison, according to 1970 census figures, of the almost 20,000 elementary and secondary teachers employed in the St. Louis area, 15.4% were African American.

        <title>Definition: Two-sided p-values</title>
        <p>Two-sided p-values are used with two-sided alternative hypotheses (≠, not equal to). A two-sided p-value considers outcomes in both tails that are at least as rare as the observed result, where <em>at least as rare</em> could be defined as having a smaller tail probability of occurring as the observed statistic. If the null distribution is symmetric, the approaches are equivalent and the two-sided p-value will be double the one-sided p-value.</p>

In other words, it is plausible that this is a 50/50 process. However, this analysis cannot be used as proof that π = 0.50, as other values could be plausible as well. The sample data allow for many (technically, infinitely many) plausible values of this probability, as you will explore in the next investigation.</p>
        
        <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> Recall that the process we are using to testing our hypotheses is to first assume the null hypothesis is true. For this reason, we can never use this process as evidence <em>for</em> the null hypothesis, only lack of evidence <em>against</em> it. Keep in mind the saying "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Also, note that our evidence depends on the form of the alternative hypothesis. A more complete statement is that we do not have evidence in favor of the alternative that we specified, and that our strength of evidence could differ if we started with a different alternative hypothesis.</p>

      <title>Investigation 1.6: Kissing the Right Way</title>
      
      <p>In the previous investigation, you learned how to decide whether a hypothesized value of the parameter is plausible based on a two-sided p-value. The two-sided p-value is used when you do not have a prior suspicion or interest in whether the hypothesized value is too large or too small. In fact, in many studies we may not even really have a hypothesized value, but are more interested in using the sample data to estimate the value of the parameter. What are all the plausible values for the parameter?</p>
      
      <p>Most people are right-handed and even the right eye is dominant for most people. Researchers have long believed that late-stage human embryos tend to turn their heads to the right. German bio-psychologist Onur Güntürkün (Nature, 2003) conjectured that this tendency to turn to the right manifests itself in other ways as well, so he studied kissing couples to see whether both people tend to lean their heads to the right more often than to their left (and if so, how strong the tendency is). He and his researchers observed couples from age 13 to 70 in public places such as airports, train stations, beaches, and parks in the United States, Germany, and Turkey. The observers were careful not to include couples who were holding objects such as luggage that might have affected which direction they turned. We will model the overall decision-making process when kissing as a binomial random process.</p>

        <title>Study Conclusions</title>
        <p>The researchers are assuming they have a representative sample from a binomial random process and want to estimate <m>\pi</m>, the underlying probability that a randomly selected kissing couple leans to the right. Based on this sample of 124 observations, we estimate <m>\pi</m> to be close to <m>\hat{p} = 80/124 = 0.645</m>. However, we know there is some sampling variability, so we want to find an interval of values that appear to be plausible values of <m>\pi</m>. We do this by finding the values of <m>\pi_0</m> for which the two-sided p-value (<m>H_0: \pi = \pi_0</m> vs. <m>H_a: \pi \neq \pi_0</m>) is greater than 0.05. These are all the values of the parameter such that our sample result is not overly surprising. You should have found this "95% confidence interval," using the "smallest tail probability" approach, to be approximately 0.557 to 0.727 (results from using different software or the applet will differ slightly). Thus, based on these sample results, we are "confident" that the actual value of <m>\pi</m>, the probability a random kissing couple leans right, is between 0.56 and 0.73.</p>
        
        <p>A 99% confidence interval for <m>\pi</m> extends from 0.529 to 0.749 (a smaller lower endpoint and a larger upper endpoint, but a similar midpoint) and therefore includes additional plausible values of the parameter compared to the 95% interval. The 99% confidence interval is wider than the 95% interval because a higher level of confidence requires more "room for error." You will learn other methods for calculating confidence intervals for a binomial process in the next section.</p>
        
        <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> In this investigation you have learned a second type of "statistical inference": providing an interval of plausible values for the parameter based on an observed sample statistic. Confidence intervals provide a nice companion to tests of significance and are also very useful by themselves. Whereas a test of significance allows you to test the plausibility of a specific hypothesized value, if you reject the null hypothesis, the test of significance provides no information as to how different the actual parameter is from the hypothesized value. If you fail to reject the null hypothesis, you only know that the tested value is one of many plausible values. A confidence interval provides an estimate (with bounds) of the actual value of the parameter. You will learn some additional methods for finding confidence intervals later in this text, but do be aware that some software packages use different methods for finding the "exact" binomial two-sided p-values.</p>

        <title>Probability Detour – Binomial Confidence Intervals</title>
        
        <p>Probably the most well-known binomial confidence interval method is the <term>Clopper-Pearson method</term> (Biometrika, 1934). Rather than using two-sided p-values, it will consider a value for <m>\pi</m> plausible as long as the one-sided tail probability is smaller than (1 – confidence level)/2. One advantage of the Clopper-Pearson method is there is a simple computer algorithm for finding it, rather than needing to check all values as you have done here.</p>
        
        <p>The method we first showed you (keeping all values of <m>\pi</m> with a two-sided p-value larger than (1 – confidence level) using the two-sided p-value based on the tail probabilities) is attributed to <term>Blaker</term> (The Canadian Journal of Statistics, 2000). We could refer to this as the "smallest tail probability" method.</p>
        
        <p>Another approach would be to use the "smallest p-value" approach for the two-sided p-value, switching to using P(X = x) to find values of x more extreme than observed in finding the two-sided p-value. This method, attributed to <term>Sterne</term> (Biometrika, 1954), has the disadvantage that the interval produced can have holes! For example, a value like 0.12 may be in the interval of plausible values, the value 0.13 may not, and the value 0.14 may be again.</p>
        
        <p>Many prefer the Blaker method to the holes of the Sterne method, and Blaker's method is now gaining favor over Clopper-Pearson because the intervals tend to be shorter. We will see some other methods later in this text as well. For now, keep in mind the likely duality between confidence intervals and tests of significance: The confidence interval is the set of values for which we would fail to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the two-sided alternative. So we can interpret the confidence interval as the set of plausible values for the parameter in that they are the values such that our observed sample result would not be surprising. Keep in mind that saying a value is <em>plausible</em> is not the same as saying a value is <em>probable</em>. We won't make probability statements about parameter values in this text.</p>
