  <title>Investigation 3.7: CPR vs. Chest Compressions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>For many years, if a person experienced a heart attack and a bystander called 911, the dispatcher instructed the bystander in how to administer chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation (a combination known as CPR) until the emergency team arrived. Some researchers believe that giving instruction in chest compression alone (CC) would be a more effective approach. In the 1990s, a randomized comparative experiment was conducted in Seattle involving 518 cases (Hallstrom, Cobb, Johnson, &amp; Copass, <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, 2000): In 278 cases, the dispatcher gave instructions in standard CPR to the bystander, and in the remaining 240 cases the dispatcher gave instructions in CC alone. A total of 64 patients survived to discharge from the hospital: 29 in the CPR group and 35 in the CC group.</p>

  <paragraphs>
    <p>Because the sample sizes are large in this study, you should not be surprised that the probability distribution in (d) is approximately normal. The large sample sizes allow us to approximate the hypergeometric distribution with a normal distribution. Thus, with large samples sizes (e.g., at least 5 successes and at least 5 failures in each group), an alternative to Fisher's Exact Test is the two-sample z-test that you studied in Section 3.1.</p>
