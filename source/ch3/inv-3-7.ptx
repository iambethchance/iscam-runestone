  <title>Investigation 3.7: CPR vs. Chest Compressions</title>

  <introduction>
    <sidebyside widths="65% 30%" margins="0% 5%">
      <p>For many years, if a person experienced a heart attack and a bystander called 911, the dispatcher instructed the bystander in how to administer chest compression plus mouth-to-mouth ventilation (a combination known as CPR) until the emergency team arrived. Some researchers believe that giving instruction in chest compression alone (CC) would be a more effective approach. </p>

    <p>In the 1990s, a randomized comparative experiment was conducted in Seattle involving 518 cases (Hallstrom, Cobb, Johnson, &amp; Copass, <url href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200005253422101"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, 2000</url>): In 278 cases, the dispatcher gave instructions in standard CPR to the bystander, and in the remaining 240 cases the dispatcher gave instructions in CC alone. A total of 64 patients survived to discharge from the hospital: 29 in the CPR group and 35 in the CC group.</p>

  <remark>
    <p>Because the sample sizes are large in this study, you should not be surprised that the probability distribution in <xref ref="inv3-7-d" text="custom">checkpoint 4</xref> is approximately normal. The large sample sizes allow us to approximate the hypergeometric distribution with a normal distribution. Thus, with large samples sizes (e.g., at least 5 successes and at least 5 failures in each group), an alternative to Fisher's Exact Test is the two-sample <em>z</em>-test that you studied in Section 3.1.</p>

      <p>To make sure the probability mass at 29 is included, we could consider finding the probability for something just above 29 (e.g., 29.5 and 34.5) or applying an Adjusted Wald correction (adding one success and one failure to each sample), though that seems to work better for the confidence interval performance than matching the p-value to the exact. In this case, the adjusted Wald moves the statistic further from zero but with a larger se so the p-value doesn't change much.</p>
      <p>The p-value from the normal distribution is a little low but the continuity correction makes the approximation much more accurate.</p>

      <p>(v) The endpoints of the confidence interval will reverse sign</p>
      <p>Note: Even with a 90% confidence level, zero is captured in the interval, even though we rejected the null hypothesis for a 10% level of significance. This can happen when you compare a one-sided p-value to a confidence interval which corresponds to a two-sided p-value. The other issue is even 0.0896 is not all that large of a value, so even if you consider the difference statistically significant, it's not clear whether the CC treatment has a "large" benefit.</p>
