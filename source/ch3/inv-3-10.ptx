<title>The Study</title>

      <p>Connor et al. (<url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12003884/" visual="pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"><em>British Medical Journal</em>, May 2002</url>) reported on a study that investigated whether sleeplessness is related to car crashes. The researchers identified all drivers or passengers of eligible light vehicles who were admitted to a hospital or died as a result of a car crash on public roads in the Auckland, New Zealand region between April 1998 and July 1999.</p>

    <p>Through cluster sampling, they identified a sample of 571 drivers who had been involved in a crash resulting in injury and a sample of 588 drivers who had not been involved in such a crash as representative of people driving on the region's roads during the study period. The researchers asked the individuals (or proxy interviewees) whether they had a full night's sleep (at least seven hours mostly between 11pm and 7am) any night during the previous week. The researchers found that 61 of the 535 crash drivers who responded and 44 of the 588 "no crash" drivers had not gotten at least one full night's sleep in the previous week.</p>

    <solution>
      <p>Because this is a case-control study, the odds ratio is the most appropriate statistic. The researchers controlled the number of crash and no-crash drivers, so we cannot meaningfully calculate the risk of having a crash.</p>
      <p>Odds ratio = (61/44) / (474/544) = 1.386 / 0.871 = 1.59</p>
      <p>The odds of being in a crash if didn't get a full night's sleep were 1.59 times higher than the odds of being in a crash if did get at least one full night's sleep. (Note: this is the same as the odds of not getting a full night's sleep for the crash victims vs. the odds of not getting a full night's sleep for the non-crash subjects.)</p>
      <p>This does support the conjecture that sleeplessness is related to car crashes, as the odds ratio is notably greater than 1.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Summarize (with justification) the conclusions you would draw from this study (using both the p-value and a confidence interval, and addressing both the population you are willing to generalize to and whether or not you are drawing a cause-and-effect conclusion).</p>
      <p><response/></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>We have strong evidence (p-value = 0.0158) that sleep-deprived drivers have higher odds (6% to 139% higher) of being in a car crash, at least for drivers like these New Zealand drivers.</p>
      <p>The 95% confidence interval (1.06, 2.39) indicates that the odds are approximately 1 to 2.4 times higher for sleepy drivers. Since this interval does not contain 1, we have statistically significant evidence of an association.</p>
      <p>However, we cannot draw a cause-and-effect conclusion because this was an observational study. There could be confounding variables (e.g., driver experience, time of day, road conditions, alcohol use).</p>
      <p>We should apply these results only to drivers in Auckland, New Zealand at that time, as that is the population from which the sample was drawn.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>The proportions of drivers who had not gotten a full night's sleep in the previous week were 0.107 for the case group of drivers who had been involved in a crash, compared to 0.075 for the control group who had not. Because these proportions are small, and because of the awkward roles of the explanatory and response variables in this study (we would much rather make a statement about the proportion of sleepless drivers who are involved in crashes), the odds ratio is a more meaningful statistic to calculate. The sample odds of having missed out on a full night's sleep were 1.59 times higher for the case group than for the control group. By the invariance of the odds ratio, we can also state that the sample odds of having an accident are 1.59 times (almost 60%) higher for those who do not get a full night sleep than those who do. The empirical p-value (less than 5%) provides moderately strong evidence that such an extreme value for the sample odds ratio is unlikely to have arisen by chance alone if the proportion of drivers with sleepless nights was 0.09 for both the population of "cases" and the population of "controls." (Using a one-sided Fisher's Exact Test, we get p-value = 0.016.) A 95% confidence interval for the population odds ratio extends from 1.06 to 2.39 (1.04 to 2.45 with R). This interval provides statistically significant evidence that the population odds ratio exceeds 1.0 and that, with 95% confidence, the odds of having an accident are about 1 to 2.5 times higher for the sleepy drivers than for well rested drivers. We cannot attribute this association to a cause-and-effect relationship because this was an observational (case-control) study. We might also want to restrict our conclusions to New Zealand drivers.</p>

    <title>Practice Problem 3.10</title>

    <p>Another landmark study on smoking began in 1952 (<url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12308037/" visual="pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">Hammond and Horn, 1958</url>, "Smoking and death rates—Report on forty-four months of follow-up of 187,783 men: II. Death rates by cause," <em>JAMA</em>). They used 22,000 American Cancer Society volunteers as interviewers. Each interviewer was to ask 10 healthy white men between the ages of 50 and 69 to complete a questionnaire on smoking habits. Each year during the 44-month follow-up, the interviewer reported whether or not the man had died, and if so, how. They ended up tracking 187,783 men in nine states (CA, IL, IA, MI, MN, NJ, NY, PA, WI). Almost 188,000 were followed up by the volunteers through October 1955, during which time about 11,870 of the men had died, 488 from lung cancer. The following table classifies the men as having a history of regular cigarette smoking or not and whether or not they died from lung cancer. In this study, nonsmokers are grouped with occasional smokers, including pipe- and cigar-only smokers.</p>
