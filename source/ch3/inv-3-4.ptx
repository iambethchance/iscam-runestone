  <title>Investigation 3.4: Botox for Back Pain</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>A 2001 study (Foster, Clapp, Erickson, <ampersand/> Jabbari, <em>Neurology</em>, "Botulinum toxin A and chronic low back pain: A randomized, double-blind study") examined the efficacy of botulinum A (botox, used in various cosmetic and medical procedures) in lower back pain. An excerpt from the journal article follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Thirty-one consecutive patients with chronic low back pain who met the inclusion criteria were studied: 15 received 200 units of botulinum toxin type A, 40 units/site at five lumbar paravertebral levels on the side of maximum discomfort, and 16 received normal saline. Each patient's baseline level of pain and degree of disability was documented using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire (OLBPQ). The authors reevaluated the patients at 3 and 8 weeks (visual analogue scale) and at 8 weeks (OLBPQ).</p>

      <p>At 3 weeks, 11 of 15 patients who received botulinum toxin (73.3%) had >50% pain relief vs four of 16 (25%) in the saline group (p = 0.012). At 8 weeks, nine of 15 (60%) in the botulinum toxin group and two of 16 (12.5%) in the saline group had relief (p = 0.009). Repeat OLBPQ at 8 weeks showed improvement in 10 of 15 (66.7%) in the botulinum toxin group vs three of 16 (18.8%) in the saline group (p = 0.011). No patient experienced side effects.</p>

    <title>Definition: Randomized, Comparative, Double-Blind Experiment</title>
    <p>A <term>randomized, comparative, double-blind experiment</term><idx><h>randomized, comparative, double-blind experiment</h></idx> includes two or more groups being compared, random assignment of "subjects" to groups, and double-blindness (neither the subjects nor the evaluators of the response variable knows which treatment group the subject is in, to guard against the placebo effect and other subjective biases). These types of studies, brought to the forefront of scientific attention by R.A. Fisher (1935), are considered the gold standard for determining cause-and-effect relationships between variables.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>Keep in mind, it is not always feasible to design such a study. You also need to be cautious of the Hawthorne effect – people involved in a study sometimes act differently just by virtue of being in a study – and other issues of realism and feasibility, such as:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><p>Are some ethnic groups less likely to enroll in such a study?</p></li>
      <li><p>Maybe those who volunteer for an early vaccine trial differ systematically from those who volunteer for the second drug developed?</p></li>
      <li><p>When is it safe to enroll younger children in such drug trials?</p></li>
      <li><p>How do we assess the long-term effects of second-hand smoking on pregnant women?</p></li>

    <p>Researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to determine whether taking large amounts of Vitamin E protects against prostate cancer (<em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>, 1998). To study this question, they enrolled 29,133 Finnish men, all smokers, between the ages of 50 and 69. The men were divided into two groups: One group took vitamin E and a second group took a placebo. The researchers followed all the men for eight years and then determined whether they had developed prostate cancer. They found that participants taking vitamin E were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer.</p>

    <p>In a study published in the July 2003 issue of the journal <em>Psychosomatic Medicine</em>, researchers reported that people who tend to think positive thoughts catch a cold less often than those who tend to think negative thoughts. The scientists recruited 334 initially healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 54 years through advertisements in the Pittsburgh area, and they first interviewed them over a two-week period to gauge their emotional state, eventually assigning them a numerical score for positive emotions and a numerical score for negative emotions. Then the subjects were quarantined before the researchers injected rhinovirus, the germ that causes colds, into each subject's nose. The subjects were then monitored for five days for the development of cold-like symptoms. Subjects scoring in the bottom third for positive emotions were three times more likely to catch a cold than those scoring the top third for positive emotions.</p>
