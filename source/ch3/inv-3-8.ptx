(<url href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1414850"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, Feb. 2015</url>) randomly assigned U.K. infants (4-11 months old) with pre-existing sensitivity to peanut extract to either consume 6 g of peanut protein per week or to avoid peanuts until 60 months of age. The table below shows the results for infants who were not initially sensitized to peanuts and whether or not the child had developed a peanut allergy at 60 months.</p>

      <p>Use Fisher's Exact Test to investigate whether these data provide convincing evidence that the probability of developing a peanut allergy is larger among children who avoid peanuts for the first 60 months.

    <statement>
      <p>Would you feel any differently about the magnitude of the difference in proportions if the conditional proportions developing a peanut allergy had been 0.500 and 0.55? Explain.</p>
      <p><var width="60" height="3"/></p>

    <solution>
      <p>Yes, a difference of 0.05 (5 percentage points) seems much less impressive when the base rates are 50% and 55% compared to 1% and 6%. The absolute difference is the same, but the relative change is quite different.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>When the <em>baseline rate</em> (probability) of success is small, an alternative statistic to consider rather than the <em>difference</em> in the conditional proportions (which will also have to be small by the nature of the data) is the <em>ratio</em> of the conditional proportions. First used with medical studies where "success" is often defined to be an unpleasant event (e.g., death), this ratio was termed the <em>relative risk</em>.</p>
  </paragraphs>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Definition: Relative Risk</title>
    <p>The <term>relative risk</term><idx><h>relative risk</h></idx> is the ratio of the conditional proportions, often intentionally set up so that the value is larger than one:</p>
    <p><me>RR = \frac{\hat{p}_1}{\hat{p}_2}</me></p>
    <p>where <m>\hat{p}_1</m> is the larger proportion and <m>\hat{p}_2</m> is the smaller proportion.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <p>The relative risk tells us how many times higher the "risk" or "likelihood" of "success" is in group 1 compared to group 2.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="inv3-8-d">
    <title>Calculate Relative Risk</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Determine and interpret the ratio of the conditional proportions who developed peanut allergy between the peanut avoiders and the peanut consumers in this study.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Relative risk = 0.060 / 0.010 = 5.85</p>
      <p>Children who avoided peanuts were about 5.85 times more likely to develop a peanut allergy than children who consumed peanuts.</p>
    </solution>
    <response/>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="inv3-8-e">
    <title>Percentage Change</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Because we are now working with a ratio, we can also interpret this statistic in terms of percentage change. Subtract one from the relative risk value and multiply by 100% to determine what percentage higher the proportion who developed a peanut allergy is in the avoidance group compared to the consumption group.</p>
      <p><var width="40"/></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>(5.85 - 1) × 100% = 485%</p>
      <p>The proportion who developed a peanut allergy is 485% higher in the avoidance group.</p>
    </solution>
    <response/>
  </exercise>

  <paragraphs>
    <p>Of course, now we would also like a confidence interval for the corresponding parameter, the ratio of the underlying probabilities of allergy between these two treatments. When we produced confidence intervals for other parameters, we examined the sampling distribution of the corresponding statistic to see how values of that statistic varied under repeated random sampling. So now let's examine the behavior of the relative risk of conditional proportions using the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/chisqshuffle/ChiSqShuffle.htm?twobytwo=1&amp;hideExtras=1">Analyzing Two-Way Tables applet</url> to simulate the random assignment process (as opposed to simulating the random sampling from a binomial process) under the (null) assumption that there's no difference between the two treatments.

  <exercise xml:id="inv3-8-h">
    <title>Mean Near 1</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Why does it make sense that the mean of the simulated relative risks is close to the value 1?</p>
      <hint>
        <p>Remember the assumption behind your simulation analysis.</p>
      </hint>
      <p><var width="60" height="2"/></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>Under the null hypothesis, the two treatments are equally effective, so the ratio of the probabilities should be 1 (no difference).</p>

  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="inv3-8-i">
    <title>Skewness</title>
    <statement>
      <p>You should notice skewness in the distribution of relative risk values. Explain why it is not surprising for the distribution of this statistic to be skewed to the right (especially with smaller sample sizes).</p>
      <p><var width="60" height="3"/></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>A ratio can be any positive value. Values close to 1 are restricted to fall between 0 and 2, but large ratios can extend far to the right (e.g., 5, 10, 100, etc.). This creates right skewness.</p>

  <p><term>Note:</term> If the number of successes in either group equals zero, the applet adds 0.5 to each cell of the table before calculating the relative risk in order to avoid dividing by zero.</p>

<p>In fact, this distribution is usually well modeled by a <em>log normal distribution</em>.</p>
  <exercise xml:id="inv3-8-j">
    <title>Log Transformation</title>

      <p> To verify this, check the ln relative risk box (in the lower left corner, or choose from pull-down menu) to take the natural log of each relative risk value and display a new histogram of these transformed values.

      <p><var width="60" height="3"/></p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>No, the p-value has not changed. Taking the log is a monotonic transformation, so it doesn't change the ranking of values or which ones are extreme.</p>

    <response/>
  </exercise>

  <paragraphs>
    <p>While the log transformation does not impact the p-value, it does impact the confidence interval. So far you have seen the standard deviation of the null distribution, but that assumes the probability of success is the same for both treatments. Instead, we want to find a standard deviation of the ln rel risk values without making that assumption.</p>
  </paragraphs>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Theoretical Result</title>
    <p>It can be shown that the standard error of the ln relative risk is approximated by:</p>
    <p><me>SE(\ln(RR)) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{A} - \frac{1}{A+B}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{C} - \frac{1}{C+D}\right)}</me></p>
    <p>where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m> are the observed counts in the 2×2 table of data, with <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> representing the number of "successes" in the two groups. Having this formula allows us to determine the variability from sample to sample without conducting the simulation first.</p>

    <title>Calculate Standard Error</title>
    <statement>

      <me>SE = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{183}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{195}\right)} </me>
      <me>= \sqrt{0.0854 + 0.4949} = \sqrt{0.5803} = 0.762</me>
      <p>This should be reasonably close to (but somewhat different from) the simulation SD, as we're not assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>

  </exercise>

  <paragraphs>
    <p><term>Note:</term> The variability in the statistic under the null hypothesis (as estimated by the simulation) should be in the ballpark but not all that close to the variability in the statistic estimated from the data. If we used a pooled <m>\hat{p}</m>, modelling the null hypothesis to be true, the results are usually a bit more similar: Assuming null hypothesis is true: <m>\sqrt{1/6.34 - 1/183 + 1/6.76 - 1/195} \approx 0.543</m>. In a case like this where we have strong evidence against the null hypothesis, using the observed counts is more appropriate.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>This study provided strong evidence that children with pre-existing sensitivity to peanut extract are more likely to develop a peanut allergy by 5 years of age if they avoid consuming peanuts than if they consume peanuts (exact one-sided p-value = 0.0074, <em>z</em>-score = 2.66). To estimate the size of the difference, focusing on the difference in "success" probabilities has some limitations. In particular, if the probabilities are small it may be difficult for us to interpret the magnitude of the difference between the values. Also, we have to be very careful with our language, focusing on the difference in the allergy probabilities and not the percentage change. An alternative is to construct a confidence interval for the relative risk (ratio of conditional probabilities). An approximation exists (even with rather small sample sizes) for a <em>z</em>-interval for the ln(relative risk) which can then be back-transformed to an interval for long-run relative risk. Many practitioners prefer focusing on this ratio parameter rather than the difference. From this study, we are 95% confident that ratio of the probabilities of peanut allergy is between 1.32 and 26.08. This means that avoiding peanuts rather than consuming some 6g/week raises the probability of developing a peanut allergy by between 32% and 2500%.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <p><term>Note:</term> It can be risky to interpret the relative risk in isolation without considering the absolute risks (conditional proportions) as well. For example, doubling a very small probability may not be noteworthy, depending on the context. You should also note that the percentage change calculation and interpretation depends on which group (e.g., treatment or control) is used as the reference group.</p>

    <title>Practice Problem 3.8B: Knee Surgery Study</title>

    <p>A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial involved patients aged 36-65 years who had knee injuries consistent with a degenerative medial meniscus tear (Shivonen et al., <url href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1305189"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, 2013</url>). Patients received either the most common orthopedic procedure (arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, <m>n_1 = 70</m>) or sham surgery that simulated the sounds, sensations, and timing of the real surgery (<m>n_2 = 76</m>). After 12 months, 54 of those in the treatment group reported satisfaction, compared to 53 in the sham surgery.</p>
