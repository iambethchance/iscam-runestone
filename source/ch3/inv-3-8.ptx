  <title>Investigation 3.8: Peanut Allergies</title>
<introduction>In this investigation you will see a situation where we may want to use a different parameter for comparing two groups on a quantitative variable. Which means we then need to think about the sampling/randomization distribution of the new statistic.</introduction>

        <p>Peanut allergies have increased in prevalence in the last decade, but can they be prevented? Even among infants with a high risk of allergy? Is it better to avoid the problematic food or to encourage early introduction?</p>

(<url href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1414850"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, Feb. 2015</url>) randomly assigned U.K. infants (4-11 months old) with pre-existing sensitivity to peanut extract to either consume 6 g of peanut protein per week or to avoid peanuts until 60 months of age. The table below shows the results for infants who were not initially sensitized to peanuts and whether or not the child had developed a peanut allergy at 60 months.</p>

      <p>Yes, a difference of 0.05 (5 percentage points) seems much less impressive when the base rates are 50% and 55% compared to 1% and 6%. The absolute difference is the same, but the relative change is quite different.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>When the <em>baseline rate</em> (probability) of success is small, an alternative statistic to consider rather than the <em>difference</em> in the conditional proportions (which will also have to be small by the nature of the data) is the <em>ratio</em> of the conditional proportions. First used with medical studies where "success" is often defined to be an unpleasant event (e.g., death), this ratio was termed the <em>relative risk</em>.</p>
  </paragraphs>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Definition: Relative Risk</title>
    <p>The <term>relative risk</term><idx><h>relative risk</h></idx> is the ratio of the conditional proportions, often intentionally set up so that the value is larger than one:</p>
    <p><me>RR = \frac{\hat{p}_1}{\hat{p}_2}</me></p>
    <p>where <m>\hat{p}_1</m> is the larger proportion and <m>\hat{p}_2</m> is the smaller proportion.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <p>The relative risk tells us how many times higher the "risk" or "likelihood" of "success" is in group 1 compared to group 2.</p>

  <paragraphs>
    <p>Of course, now we would also like a confidence interval for the corresponding parameter, the ratio of the underlying probabilities of allergy between these two treatments. When we produced confidence intervals for other parameters, we examined the sampling distribution of the corresponding statistic to see how values of that statistic varied under repeated random sampling. So now let's examine the behavior of the relative risk of conditional proportions using the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/chisqshuffle/ChiSqShuffle.htm?twobytwo=1&amp;hideExtras=1">Analyzing Two-Way Tables applet</url> to simulate the random assignment process (as opposed to simulating the random sampling from a binomial process) under the (null) assumption that there's no difference between the two treatments.

      <p>A ratio can be any positive value. Values close to 1 are restricted to fall between 0 and 2, but large ratios can extend far to the right (e.g., 5, 10, 100, etc.). This creates right skewness.</p>

    <p>While the log transformation does not impact the p-value, it does impact the confidence interval. So far you have seen the standard deviation of the null distribution, but that assumes the probability of success is the same for both treatments. Instead, we want to find a standard deviation of the ln rel risk values without making that assumption.</p>

    <title>Theoretical Result</title>
    <p>It can be shown that the standard error of the ln relative risk is approximated by:</p>
    <p><me>SE(\ln(RR)) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{A} - \frac{1}{A+B}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{C} - \frac{1}{C+D}\right)}</me></p>
    <p>where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m> are the observed counts in the 2×2 table of data, with <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> representing the number of "successes" in the two groups. Having this formula allows us to determine the variability from sample to sample without conducting the simulation first.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>This study provided strong evidence that children with pre-existing sensitivity to peanut extract are more likely to develop a peanut allergy by 5 years of age if they avoid consuming peanuts than if they consume peanuts (exact one-sided p-value = 0.0074, <em>z</em>-score = 2.66). To estimate the size of the difference, focusing on the difference in "success" probabilities has some limitations. In particular, if the probabilities are small it may be difficult for us to interpret the magnitude of the difference between the values. Also, we have to be very careful with our language, focusing on the difference in the allergy probabilities and not the percentage change. An alternative is to construct a confidence interval for the relative risk (ratio of conditional probabilities). An approximation exists (even with rather small sample sizes) for a <em>z</em>-interval for the ln(relative risk) which can then be back-transformed to an interval for long-run relative risk. Many practitioners prefer focusing on this ratio parameter rather than the difference. From this study, we are 95% confident that ratio of the probabilities of peanut allergy is between 1.32 and 26.08. This means that avoiding peanuts rather than consuming some 6g/week raises the probability of developing a peanut allergy by between 32% and 2500%.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <p><term>Note:</term> It can be risky to interpret the relative risk in isolation without considering the absolute risks (conditional proportions) as well. For example, doubling a very small probability may not be noteworthy, depending on the context. You should also note that the percentage change calculation and interpretation depends on which group (e.g., treatment or control) is used as the reference group.</p>

  <p><term>Note:</term> <em>Efficacy</em> is defined as 1 – <em>risk of vaccinated group/risk of unvaccinated group</em> × 100%.</p>
