    <title>Odds Ratio Procedures</title>

    <p><alert>Statistic:</alert> <m>\hat{\tau} = [\hat{p}_1/(1-\hat{p}_1)]/[\hat{p}_2/(1-\hat{p}_2)] = (A \times D) / (B \times C)</m></p>
    <p>(typically set up to be larger than one)</p>

    <p><alert>Hypotheses:</alert> H<subscript>0</subscript>: <m>\tau = 1</m>; H<subscript>a</subscript>: <m>\tau</m> &lt;, >, or ≠ 1</p>

    <p><alert>p-value:</alert> Fisher's Exact Test</p>
    <p>You can also use simulation (assuming the probabilities of success are equal) or a normal approximation on <m>\ln(\hat{\tau})</m></p>

    <p><alert>Confidence interval for <m>\tau</m>:</alert> exponential of</p>
    <p><me>\ln(\hat{\tau}) \pm z^*\sqrt{\frac{1}{A}+\frac{1}{B}+\frac{1}{C}+\frac{1}{D}}</me></p>

    <p><alert>Technology:</alert></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>In Two-way Tables applet: Choose Odds Ratio as statistic and check box for 95% CI</li>
      <li>In R: fisher.test(matrix(c(a, c, b, d), nrow=2), alt = )</li>
      <li>In JMP: From the Contingency Analysis hot spot, choose Odds Ratio</li>
    </ul></p>

    <title>Relationship Between Relative Risk and Odds Ratio</title>
    
    <p>The graphs below show how (a) the probability of success and odds of success are related and (b) how relative risk and odds ratios are similar when the difference in proportions is small. Also note that when the difference in proportions is zero, the relative risk and the odds ratio are both one.</p>
    
    <p>[Note: Graphs would be included here showing the relationships]</p>
