  <title>Investigation 3.6: Is Yawning Contagious?</title>

      <stack>
        <p>The folks at <em>MythBusters</em>, a popular television program on the Discovery Channel, investigated whether yawning is contagious by recruiting fifty subjects at a local flea market and asking them to sit in one of three small rooms for a short period of time. For some of the subjects, the attendee yawned while leading them to two of the rooms (planting a yawn "seed"), whereas for the other subjects the attendee did not yawn. As time passed, the researchers watched (via a hidden camera) to see which subjects yawned.</p>

    <title>Exact p-value</title>
    <p>The simulations you have conducted in Investigations 3.5 (Dolphin Therapy) and above approximated the p-value for two-way tables arising from random assignment by assuming the row and column totals are fixed. In this case, the probability of obtaining a specific number of successes in one group can be calculated exactly using the hypergeometric probability distribution. (We used the independent binomial distributions with the teen hearing loss study, where we wanted to sample separately from two populations and the overall number of successes was not fixed in advance.)</p>
    <p>Keep in mind, that under the null hypothesis, we are assuming the group assignments made no difference and that there would be 14 successes ("yawners") and 36 failures ("non-yawners") between the two groups regardless.</p>
    <p>Because the random assignment makes every configuration of the subjects between the two groups equally likely, we determine the probability of any particular outcome for the number of yawners and non-yawners by first counting the total number of ways to assign 34 of the subjects to the yawn-seed group (and 16 to the no-yawn-seed group) in the denominator. The numerator is then the number of ways to get a particular set of configurations for that group, such as those consisting of 10 yawners and 24 non-yawners.</p>

  <paragraphs>
    <p>In this study, we had <m>N = 50</m> subjects and we defined yawning to be success so <m>M = 14</m>. We also arbitrarily chose to focus on the yawn-seed group, so <m>n = 34</m>. This calculation works out the same if you had defined "not yawning" to be a success and/or if you had focused on the 16 people in the no-yawn-seed group. You just need to make sure you count consistently.</p>
    <p>We will continue to define the p-value to be the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed in the actual study. Because we expected more yawners in the yawn-seed group, the p-value is the probability of randomly assigning at least 10 of the yawners in the yawn-seed group.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>With a large p-value of 0.513 (Fisher's Exact Test), we do not have any evidence that the difference between the two groups (with and without yawn seed) was created from something other than the random assignment process. If there was nothing to the theory that yawning is contagious, by "luck of the draw" alone, we would expect 10 or more of the yawners to end up in the yawn seed group in more than 50% of random assignments. Although the study results were in the conjectured direction, the difference between the yawning proportions was not large enough to convince us that the probability of yawning is truly larger when a yawn seed is planted. The researchers could try the study again with a larger sample size to increase the power of their test. The researchers also may want to be cautious in generalizing these results beyond the population of volunteers at a local flea market or how naturalistic the setting of leading individuals to a small room to wait is.</p>
