  <title>Chapter 3: Comparing Two Proportions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, you will focus on comparing results from two groups on a categorical variable. These groups could be samples from different populations or they could have been deliberately formed during the design of the study (a third source of possible randomness). You will again consider multiple ways to analyze the statistical significance of the difference in the groups, namely simulation, exact methods, and normal approximations to answer whether the observed difference in the groups could have happened “by chance alone.” You will also continue to consider issues of statistical confidence and types of errors. A key consideration to keep in mind will be the scope of conclusions that you can draw from the study based on how the data were collected.</p>
