  <title>Sec 3.3: Comparing Two Treatment Probabilities</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In the previous section, we saw potential benefits to using random assignment – creating groups that we are willing to consider equivalent. However, there is still the chance that "luck of the draw" could lead to a higher success proportion for the response variable in one group. In this section you will explore a method for calculating p-values that addresses how often random assignment could create a difference between the treatment groups at least as large as the one observed.</p>
