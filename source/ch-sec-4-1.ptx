  <title>Chapter 4, Section 1: Comparing Two Groups with a Quantitative Response</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter parallels Chapter 3 in many ways. We will continue to consider studies where the goal is to compare a response variable between two groups. The difference here is that these studies will involve a quantitative response variable rather than a categorical one. The methods that we employ to analyze these data will therefore be different, but you will find that the basic concepts and principles that you learned in Chapters 1–3 still apply. These include the principle of starting with numerical and graphical summaries to explore the data, the concept of statistical significance in determining whether the difference in the distribution of the response variable between the two groups is larger than we would reasonably expect from randomness alone, and the importance of considering how the data were collected in determining the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from the study.</p>
