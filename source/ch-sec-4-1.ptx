  <title>Section 1: Comparing Two Groups with a Quantitative Response</title>

  <introduction>
   <p><em>In this section, we will focus on comparing two groups on a quantitative response variable. Again, the reasoning is still the same as in Ch. 1–3, but we will see some small changes in the details. We start with a small investigation to review key ideas.</em></p> </introduction>
