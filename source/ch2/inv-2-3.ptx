  <title>Investigation 2.3: Readability of Cancer Pamphlets</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>Researchers in Philadelphia investigated whether pamphlets containing information for cancer patients are written at a level that the cancer patients can comprehend. They applied tests to measure the reading levels of 63 cancer patients and also the readability levels of 30 cancer pamphlets (based on such factors as sentence length and number of polysyllabic words). These numbers correspond to grade levels, but cancer patient reading levels below grade 3 and above grade 12 were not determined exactly.</p>
    
    <p>The following tables indicate the number of patients at each reading level and the number of pamphlets at each readability level:</p>

    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>No, it does not; there could be differences in the shape of the data that make the two data groups not very well matched. In particular, we notice there are 17 patients who can't read the simplest pamphlet.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    
    <p>Keep in mind when examining quantitative data, that you should start by constructing some simple graphs to explore the data. In fact, you should use technology to explore a couple of different graphs (e.g., change the bin width in a histogram) to help reveal hidden patterns and unusual observations.</p>

  <assemblage xml:id="study-conclusions-2-3">
    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    
    <p>When these researchers came to the statistical consultant, they wanted a p-value for comparing the mean reading level of the patients to the mean reading level of the pamphlets. You will learn about such a test in Chapter 4. However, the statistical consultant replied that not only couldn't means be calculated, but that a simple look at the data revealed a substantial percentage of the patients with a reading level below that of the simplest pamphlet. This "descriptive" analysis was sufficient, rather than looking for a more complicated "inferential" analysis involving p-values and confidence intervals.</p>
