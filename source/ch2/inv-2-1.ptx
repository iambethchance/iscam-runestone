  <title>Investigation 2.1: Birth Weights</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>The <url href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm">CDC's Vital Statistics Online Data Portal</url> allows you to download birth records for all births in the U.S. in a particular year.</p>
    
    <p><ul>
      <li><p>Open this website and follow the Downloadable Data Files link for Birth. How large is the zip file for the U.S. data in 2024?</p></li>
      <li><p>Open the <url href="https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/DVS/natality/UserGuide2023.pdf">User's Guide for 2024</url>. How many births were recorded for the U.S. in 2024?</p></li>
      <li><p>According to this documentation file, how many total "positions" are there in the data file? What information is in the first 8 positions? What information is in the next 4 positions? How would you determine the birth month?</p></li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> If you were to download this file, it could take a minute. You would then need to unzip the file, which is then 5GB. This can be problematic to work with, especially if you were most interested in just a few of the variables. It can also be cumbersome to deal with all of the rows, especially if you just want to see general patterns. Most packages can now work with datafiles this large, but we are still pushing the limit a bit. JMP and R take a couple minutes to read in the data, and each row is still a single string (not separated into columns or tabs). One approach is to preprocess the data a bit before loading into the software package. Using a program like "awk" you can read in the data from specific positions (e.g., just the birth weights) or in R use read.fwf. Then a comma or tab delimited file would be much easier for the software to handle. <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam4/in/CDCBirths.html">Guide for recreating the 2023 datafile</url>.</p>
    
    <p>The file <url href="http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam4/data/USbirthsJan2024.txt">USbirthsJan2024.txt</url> contains information on the 297,798 births in January 2024, including birth weight (in grams), whether the baby was full term (gestation over 36 weeks), the 5 minute <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score">apgar score</url> (an immediate measure of the infant's health), and the amount of weight gained by the mother during pregnancy (in lbs). The goal of this investigation is to build a model of how birth weights can be expected to behave in the future. In particular, we will ask questions such as: Can we use that model to make predictions about certain kinds of birth weights? How reliable will our estimates be?</p>

    <title>Using Histograms</title>
    
    <p>It may still be difficult to see much in the dotplot with such a large data set, especially if there are many distinct (non-repeated) values. One solution is to "bin" the observations. Some software packages (e.g., Minitab) will do that automatically even with a dotplot. Another approach is to use a different type of graph, a histogram, that groups the data into intervals of equal width (e.g., 1000-2000, 2000-3000, …) and then construct a bar for each interval with the height of the bar representing the number or proportion of observations in that interval. Notice these bars will be touching, unlike in a bar graph, to represent the continuous rather than categorical nature of the data.</p>

    <p>Another way to assess the "fit" of a probability model to the data is with a probability plot (aka quantile plot). Probability plots work roughly like this: The computer determines how many observations are in the data set, and then reports the z-scores it would expect for the 1/nth percentiles (also called quantiles) for the probability model. The plot compares these z-scores to the observed data; if the z-scores "line up" with the observed data, then the probability plot supports that the data are behaving like the candidate distribution. The theory is that whether or not the observations follow a line can be easier to judge than whether a histogram follows a curve.</p>

  <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> Some software packages report a p-value with the normal probability plot. The null hypothesis here is that the data do follow a normal distribution, so if you fail to reject this null hypothesis you can say that the data do not provide strong evidence that they do not arise from a normally distributed population. (But keep in mind that large sample sizes will drive the p-value down, regardless of the actual shape of the population.) There are several different types of significance tests for normality, but in this text, we will focus on the visual judgement of whether the probability plot appears to follow a straight line.</p>
  
  <p>Suppose we were willing to assume that in general birth weights are approximately normally distributed with mean 3339 grams and standard deviation 462 grams. We can use this model to make predictions, like how often a baby will be of low birth weight, defined as 2500 grams or less.</p>

  <conclusion>
    <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> We can often use a theoretical model to predict how data will behave. However, it is often unclear whether the model we are using is appropriate. Sometimes we have to consider the context (e.g., biological characteristic) and presume a particular model. We can also use existing data to create a model but we need to consider what population the data are representative of and how stable we think the data generating process is (e.g., not changing over time). In this case, a normal distribution appears to underestimate the likelihood of both smaller and heavier babies (3.2% beyond 2SD rather than 5%), but overall the model is performing well, allowing us to make predictions like we did in (r).</p>
