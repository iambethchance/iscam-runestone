  <title>The Scenario</title>

  <introduction>
    <sidebyside widths="65% 30%" valign="top">
      <p>On October 2, 2005, the tour boat <em>Ethan Allen</em> capsized on Lake George in upstate New York. All 47 passengers on board were thrown into the lake, and 20 of them drowned. Although there were some claims that a large wave had hit the boat, an investigation by New York State Police (2006) concluded that the boat had been overloaded with heavy passengers. </p>

<p>In fact, the average weight of the 47 passengers was found to be 174 pounds; whereas the boat was designed with the assumption that passengers would average 140 pounds.</p> </introduction>

    <title>Conjecture about weight distribution</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Do you think the distribution of the weights of 47 passengers might vary from boat to boat, even if they were randomly selected from the same (large) population of American adults?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>

<paragraphs> <title>Population distribution</title> 
      <p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that weights of American adults in 2005 had a mean of 167 pounds and a standard deviation of 35 pounds. 
      (To convey that these are population values, we will use Greek letters to represent their values, <m>\mu = 167</m>
       and <m>\sigma = 35</m>.)</p>
       <p> If we also assume that the weight distribution has an approximately normal-shape,
       below is a possible outline of the distribution of the weights of the population of roughly 225 million adult Americans in 2005.</p>

<paragraphs>  <title>Boat Weights</title>  
  <p>Engineers estimated the maximum weight capacity of passengers that the Ethan Allen could accommodate to be 7500 pounds. If the tour boat company consistently accepted 47 passengers, what we want to know is the probability that the combined weight of the 47 passengers would exceed this capacity.</p>

    <solution>
      <p>The observational units are the different boats (or boat trips) 
with 47 passengers each. The variable is the average weight of the 47 passengers on each boat. This variable is quantitative because it is measured on a numerical scale.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  <p>Instead of focusing on the total weight of the 47 passengers, we can instead work with the average weight of the 47 passengers. </p>
  <exercise xml:id="inv2-4-d" label="I6.4.4">
    <title>Convert total weight to average weight</title>

  <p>So, to see how often the boat was sent out with too much weight, we need to know about the distribution of the average weight of 47 passengers from different boats (samples). Think about a distribution of sample mean weights from different random samples of 47 passengers, repeatedly selected from the population of adult Americans.</p>

    <title>Simulation Analysis</title>
    
    <p>To investigate this probability, we will generate random samples from a 
    hypothetical population of adults' weights. Open the
     <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/data/WeightPopulations.txt">WeightPopulations.txt</url> data file 
     and pretend each column is a different population of 20,000 adult tourists, each with a population mean weight (<m>\mu</m>) of 167 lbs and a population standard deviation (<m>\sigma</m>) of 35 lbs.</p>

<p> Using the <url href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/sampling/OneSample.html?hideExtras=1">Sampling from Finite Population</url> applet
 (below or open in own window), carry out the following steps:</p>

    <p>You should see that, as with the <xref ref="inv-1-12" text="title"/>, the shape of the population is not having much effect on the distribution of the sample means! In fact, you can show that the mean of the distribution of sample means from random samples is always equal to the mean of the population (any discrepancies you find are from not simulating enough random samples) and that, assuming the population is large compared to the size of the sample, the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is equal to <m>\sigma/\sqrt{n}</m>. This standard deviation formula applies when the population size is large (more than 20 times the size of the sample) or infinite (so the randomly selected observations can be considered independent).</p>

    <p>If all possible samples of size <m>n</m> are selected from a large population or an infinite random process with mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m>, then the sampling distribution of these sample means will have the following characteristics:</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    
    <p>In general, the shape of the distribution of sample means does not depend on the shape of the population distribution, unless you have small sample sizes. So if the population distribution itself follows a normal distribution, then we will always be willing to model the distribution of sample means with a normal distribution. However, we typically don't know the distribution of the population (that's why we need to collect data), but we can make a judgment based on the nature of the variable (e.g., biological characteristics, repeated measurements) or based on the information conveyed to us by the shape of the distribution of the sample data (e.g., normal probability plot).</p>
  
    <p>In this example, a sample size of 47 appears large enough to result in a normal distribution for the distribution of sample means. However, you may have noticed a bit of a right skew when the population was skewed and in such a situation you would want a larger sample size before you were willing to model the distribution of sample means with a normal distribution.</p>
  
    <p>Keep in mind that the results about the mean and standard deviation always hold for random samples: sample means cluster around the population mean and are less variable than individual observations! If the population size is not large, then a "finite population correction factor" can be applied as in Ch. 1.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    
    <p>Assuming the CDC values for the mean and standard deviation of adult Americans' weights, <m>\mu = 167</m> lbs and <m>\sigma = 35</m> lbs, we believe that the distribution of sample mean weights will be well modeled by a normal distribution (based both on the not extremely skewed nature of the variable and the moderately large sample size of 47, which is larger than 30). Therefore, the Central Limit Theorem allows us to predict that the distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> is approximately normal with mean 167 lbs and standard deviation <m>35/\sqrt{47} \approx 5.105</m> lbs. From this information, assuming the CDC data is representative of the population of Ethan Allen travelers, we can estimate the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 159.57 lbs or higher to be 0.9264. Therefore, it is not at all surprising that a boat carrying 47 American adults capsized. In fact, the surprising part might be that it didn't happen sooner!</p>
