  <title>Investigation 2.4: The Ethan Allen</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>In October, 2005, a tour boat named the Ethan Allen capsized on Lake George in New York with 47 passengers aboard. In the inquiries that followed, it was suggested that the tour operators should have realized that the combined weight of so many passengers was likely to exceed the weight capacity of the boat. Let's explore whether they could have predicted this.</p>

    <title>Conjecture about distribution of passenger weights</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The variable of interest in this study is weight of a passenger. For a sample of 47 passengers, make a conjecture as to the behavior of the distribution (shape, center, variability) of this variable. Include a well-labeled sketch of your conjecture below (e.g., represent 47 dots or sketch an outline of the general pattern). Include a guess of the values of the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> and the sample standard deviation <m>s</m>. [Hint: Think about the size of a typical deviation from the mean, as well as the Empirical (95%) Rule.]</p>
