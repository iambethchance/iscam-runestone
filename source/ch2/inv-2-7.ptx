  <title>Investigation 2.7: Water Oxygen Levels</title>

  <p>Scientists often monitor the "health" of water systems to determine the impact of different changes in the environment. For example, Riggs (2002) reports on a case study that monitored the dissolved oxygen downstream from a commercial hog operation. There had been problems at this site for several years (e.g., manure lagoon overflow), including several fish deaths in the previous three years just downstream of a large swale through which runoff from the hog facility had escaped. The state pollution control agency decided to closely monitor dissolved oxygen downstream of the swale for the next three years to determine whether the problem had been resolved. In particular, they wanted to see whether there was a tendency for the dissolved oxygen level in the river to be less than the 5.0 mg/l standard. Sampling was scheduled to commence in January of 2000 and run through December of 2002. The monitors took measurements at a single point in the river, approximately six tenths of a mile from the swale, once every 11 days.</p>
