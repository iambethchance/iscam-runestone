  <title>Investigation 2.7: Water Oxygen Levels</title>

  <p>Scientists often monitor the "health" of water systems to determine the impact of different changes in the environment. For example, Riggs (2002) reports on a case study that monitored the dissolved oxygen downstream from a commercial hog operation. There had been problems at this site for several years (e.g., manure lagoon overflow), including several fish deaths in the previous three years just downstream of a large swale through which runoff from the hog facility had escaped. The state pollution control agency decided to closely monitor dissolved oxygen downstream of the swale for the next three years to determine whether the problem had been resolved. In particular, they wanted to see whether there was a tendency for the dissolved oxygen level in the river to be less than the 5.0 mg/l standard. Sampling was scheduled to commence in January of 2000 and run through December of 2002. The monitors took measurements at a single point in the river, approximately six tenths of a mile from the swale, once every 11 days.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Because the dissolved oxygen measurements were taken in the same location at fixed time intervals, would you consider this a simple random sample? Do you think the sample is likely to be representative of the river conditions? Explain.</p>

    <title>Definition: Systematic Sample</title>
    <p>A <term>systematic sample</term> selects observations at fixed intervals (e.g., every 10th person in line). If the initial observation is chosen at random and there is no structure in the data matching up to the interval size (e.g., every 7th day), then such samples are generally assumed to be representative of the population. In fact, we will often simplify the analysis by assuming they behave like simple random samples.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>Both the mean (not shown) and of the median indicate that dissolved oxygen in this river tended to below the 5.0 mg/l that was cited as the "action level." Although we don't have statistically significant evidence that the long-run median DO level is below 5.0 mg/l (binomial p-value <m>\approx 0.30</m>), the researchers actually wanted to engage in remedial action if the river is found to be in non-compliance significantly more than 10% of the time. The exact binomial probability of observing 19 or more non-compliant values from a process with a 0.10 chance of non-compliance is <m>4.16 \times 10^{-11}</m>, leaving "little doubt that the 10% non-compliant criterion was exceeded at the monitoring site during 2000."</p>

    <title>Discussion: Sign Test</title>
    <p>When we use 0.50 as the hypothesized probability of success and we count how many of our quantitative observations exceed some pre-specified level, this is called the <term>sign test</term> and corresponds to a test of whether the population median equals that pre-specified level. The sign test can be advantageous over the t-test if the technical conditions for the t-test are not met (e.g., skewness in sample, not a large sample size). However, although this procedure focuses on how often you are above or below that level, it does not provide information about how far above or below as a confidence interval for the mean could.</p>
