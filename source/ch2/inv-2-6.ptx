  <title>Investigation 2.6: Healthy Body Temperatures (cont.)</title>

  <sidebyside widths="55% 40%" valign="middle">
    <p>Reconsider the research question of Investigation 2.5 where a "one-sample <m>t</m>-test" found convincing evidence with a sample mean body temperature of <m>\bar{x} = 98.249</m>°F and a sample standard deviation of <m>s = 0.733</m>°F against the hypothesis that <m>\mu = 98.6</m> in the population of healthy adults. In fact, we were 95% confident that <m>\mu</m> actually fell between 98.122 and 98.376 degrees (so not all that far from 98.6) based on an estimated standard error of <m>SE(\bar{x}) = 0.064</m>.</p>

    <title>Prediction Intervals</title>
    
    <p>It is very important to keep in mind that the confidence interval reported above only makes statements about the population mean, not individual body temperatures. But what if we instead wanted an interval to estimate the body temperature of a single randomly selected healthy adult rather than the population mean body temperature? Can we improve upon the Empirical Rule calculation?</p>

  <p>If we are willing to assume that the population follows a normal distribution (note this is more restrictive than what we need to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean), then we can construct a 95% prediction interval for an individual outcome using the <m>t</m>-distribution.</p>
  
  <assemblage xml:id="prediction-interval-definition">
    <title>Prediction Interval</title>
    
    <p>To predict an individual value, we can calculate a <term>prediction interval (PI)</term>. We construct the interval using the sample mean as our estimate, but we adjust the standard error to take into account the additional variability of an individual value from the population mean:</p>
    
    <p><me>\bar{x} \pm t_{n-1}^* s\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}</me></p>
    
    <p>This procedure is valid as long as the sample observations are randomly selected from a normally distributed population. Note that prediction intervals are not robust to violations from the normality condition even with large sample sizes.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    
    <p>For one person to determine whether they have an unusual body temperature, we need a prediction interval rather than a confidence interval for the population mean. A 95% prediction interval for the body temperature of a healthy adult turns out to be (96.79, 99.71), a fairly wide interval. We are 95% confident that a randomly selected healthy adult will have a body temperature between 96.79 and 99.71 degrees Fahrenheit. This prediction interval procedure is valid only if the population of healthy body temperatures follows a normal distribution, which seems like a reasonable assumption in this context.</p>
