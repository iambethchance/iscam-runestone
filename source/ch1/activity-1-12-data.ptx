  <title>Activity: Collecting Word Sample Data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Before beginning Investigation 1.12, you will collect a sample of words from the Gettysburg Address. Your instructor will provide you with a class section identifier.</p>
  </introduction>

  <p>The authorship of literary works is often a topic for debate. Were some of the works attributed to Shakespeare actually written by Bacon or Marlowe? Which of the anonymously published Federalist Papers were written by Hamilton, which by Madison, which by Jay? Who were the authors of the writings contained in the Bible? The fields of "literary computing" and "forensic stylometry" examine ways of numerically analyzing authors' works, looking at variables such as sentence length and rates of occurrence of specific words.</p>

    <p>The passage you will be selecting words from is Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, given November 19, 1863 on the battlefield near Gettysburg, PA. In characterizing this passage, we would ideally examine every word. However, often it is much more convenient and even more efficient to only examine a subset of words.</p>

      <p>After using the tool above:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Record your class section identifier: <var width="20"/></p></li>
        <li><p>Record the 10 word ID numbers you selected (e.g., 23, 45, 67, ...): <var width="60"/></p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Note: Keep this information - you will need it for Investigation 1.12.</em></p>
