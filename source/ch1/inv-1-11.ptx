    <title>Investigation 1.11: Ganzfeld Experiments</title>
    
    <p>
      Statistician Jessica Utts has conducted extensive analysis of studies that have investigated psychic functioning. (Combining results across multiple studies, often to increase power, is called meta-analysis.) <url href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jutts/air.pdf" visual="ics.uci.edu/~jutts">Utts (1995)</url> cites research from <url href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=D97D004003D79ED839A32B3CB8DC468B?doi=10.1.1.377.3258&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" visual="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu">Bem and Honorton (1994)</url> that analyzed studies that used a technique called ganzfeld.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In a typical ganzfeld experiment, a "receiver" is placed in a room relaxing in a comfortable chair with halved ping-pong balls over the eyes, having a red light shone on them. The receiver also wears a set of headphones through which [static] noise is played. The receiver is in this state of mild sensory deprivation for half an hour. During this time, a "sender" observes a randomly chosen target and tries to mentally send this information to the receiver <ellipsis/> The receiver is taken out of the ganzfeld state and given a set of [four] possible targets, from which they must decide which one most resembled the images they witnessed. Most commonly there are three decoys along with a copy of the target itself. [<url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_experiment" visual="wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</url>]
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Utts has stated that she believes there is convincing evidence of ESP but that the effect is small.

      In <xref ref="investigation-1-3" text="custom">Investigation 1.3</xref>, you determined that if someone was asked to choose among 5 symbols in 10 rounds, they would need to correctly identify 5 or more of the symbols to produce a p-value below 0.05 and be at least two standard deviations away from the expected 2 correct identifications. The result "5 or more correct" is often called the rejection region (the values of the statistic that lead us to reject the null hypothesis).

      <title>Definition</title>
      <p>
        A <term>Type I error</term> in a test of significance occurs when the null hypothesis is true but we decide to reject the null hypothesis. This type of error is sometimes referred to as a false positive or a "false alarm."

        <p>
          According to the applet, what is the (normal approximation) probability of making a Type I error in this study? How could you have known this in advance? (Note that the normal approximation is not required to correspond to an integer value for the rejection region.)

      <solution>
        <p>
          By setting the level of significance to 0.05, we ensure the probability of a Type I error is at most 0.05.

    <p>
      While a Type I error focuses on the null hypothesis being true, what if the null hypothesis is false – how likely are we to make the correct decision to reject the null hypothesis?

    <assemblage xml:id="type-ii-error-power-definitions">
      <title>Definitions</title>
      <p>
        A <term>Type II error</term> occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis even though the null hypothesis is false. This type of error is sometimes referred to as a false negative or a "missed opportunity."
      </p>
      <p>
        The <term>power</term> of a test when <m>\pi = \pi_a</m> is defined as the probability of (correctly) rejecting the null hypothesis assuming this specific alternative value for the parameter. Thus, power reveals how likely our test is to detect a specific difference (or improvement or effect) that really is there.

          The power is much smaller with the smaller sample size (about 32% vs 99%). This makes sense as there will be more sample-to-sample variation by chance alone with the smaller sample size, making it more difficult to distinguish observations coming from the two different distributions. In other words, there is more overlap in the two distributions and the probability of finding a sample proportion to convince us to reject the null hypothesis is smaller.

      <title>Key Ideas</title>
      <p>
        In any test of significance, we need to guard against two types of errors:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><term>Type I error</term> = falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis ("false alarm")</p></li>
          <li><p><term>Type II error</term> = failing to reject a false null hypothesis ("missed opportunity")</p></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We control the probability of a Type I error by stating a level of significance before we collect any data. We chiefly control the probability of a Type II error by determining what sample size is needed in a study to achieve a desired level of power. To do so, you need to establish in advance how false you think the null hypothesis is/what size of a difference you want to be able to detect. This is often done through subject-matter knowledge or prior study results.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <paragraphs xml:id="study-conclusions">
      <title>Study Conclusions</title>
      
      <p>
        If the researchers believe there is a genuine but small effect (say 5 percentage points) of ESP, then with a sample size of 329, there is about a 65% chance that, when the probability of a correct identification equals 0.30, they will obtain a sample result that convinces them to reject the null hypothesis that <m>\pi = 0.250</m>. With a sample size of around 500, there is over 80% chance that the researchers will find evidence of ESP when <m>\pi = 0.30</m>. Keep in mind that with a large sample size, we can often find a statistically significant result that we may not consider practically significant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Discussion:</em> When the sample size is small, the binomial distribution can be used for power calculations, but notice that the discreteness of the binomial probability distribution can complicate matters. This is another example where the normal distribution is simpler, but do keep in mind use of the normal approximation is not always valid.
