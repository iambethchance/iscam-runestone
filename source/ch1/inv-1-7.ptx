        <p>Manufacturers often perform "quality checks" to ensure that their manufacturing process is operating under certain specifications. Suppose a manager at Hershey's is concerned that his manufacturing process is no longer producing the correct color proportions (orange, yellow, brown) in Reese's candies.</p>

      <title>(a) Initial Prediction</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Prediction: A friend finds 10 orange candies in her bag. Does this convince you that the three colors are not equally likely? What other information would you want to know? What if she tells you these orange pieces were 50% of the candies in her bag?</p>
      </statement>
      <response/>
      <hint>
        <p>Consider: Knowing the total number of candies in the bag is crucial. What's the difference between 10 out of 20 versus 10 out of 100?</p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>Conjectures will vary. Knowing the total number of candies (sample size) is crucial. 10 out of 20 (50%) is much different from 10 out of 100 (10%). With 50% orange, this provides some evidence against equal proportions, but we would want more information about sampling variability.</p>

      <solution>
        <p>Yes, this is reasonably a binomial process: There are two possible outcomes (orange/not orange), a fixed number of trials (n = 25), the trials are independent (assuming sampling with replacement or from a very large population), and the probability of success (getting an orange candy) is constant for each trial.

        <p>With n = 100, we would expect less variability in the sample proportions compared to n = 25. The distribution should still be centered at 0.333 and roughly symmetric, but with much less spread. Larger sample sizes lead to more precise estimates of the population parameter.</p>

    <title>Practice Problem 1.7B</title>
    
    <p>An expert witness in a paternity suit testifies that the length (in days) of pregnancy (the time from conception to delivery of the child) is approximately normally distributed with mean <m>\mu = 270</m> days and standard deviation <m>\sigma = 10</m> days. The defendant in the suit is able to prove that he was out of the country during a period that began 280 days before the birth of the child and ended 230 days before the birth of the child.</p>
