      <title>Key Idea</title>
      <p>
        The <term>confidence level</term> of an interval procedure is supposed to indicate the long-run percentage of intervals that capture the actual parameter value, if repeated random samples were taken from the identical process. As such, the confidence level presents a measure of the <em>reliability</em> of the <em>method</em>. A <term>confidence interval</term> procedure is considered valid when the achieved long-run coverage rate matches (or comes close to) the stated (aka <em>nominal</em>) confidence level.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Statistical confidence</term> is a statement about the <em>method</em>, not a probability statement about an individual interval.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      To consider whether the one sample <m>z</m>-interval is valid for this study, we can pretend we know the process probability, generate many random samples from that process, calculate confidence intervals from the simulated samples, and see what percentage of these confidence intervals capture the actual value of the process probability that we specified.

      Because the <m>z</m>-interval procedure has the sample size conditions of the Central Limit Theorem, there are scenarios where we should not use this <m>z</m>-procedure to determine the confidence interval. In these cases, one option is to use the Exact Binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson) method.

      The Clopper-Pearson method will have a coverage rate of at least 95%, but tends to be "conservative," meaning the coverage rate is higher than 95% so the intervals are longer than they need to be. The method is also fairly complicated (as opposed to: "go two standard deviations on each side"). An alternative method that has been receiving much attention of late is often called the <term>Plus Four</term> procedure:
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="plus-four-definition">
      <title>Definition: <term>Plus Four</term> 95% Confidence Interval for <m>\pi</m></title>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Determine the number of successes (<m>X</m>) and sample size (<m>n</m>) in the study</p></li>
          <li><p>Increase the number of successes by two and the sample size by four, and calculate a new proportion: <m>\tilde{p} = (X + 2)/(n + 4)</m>. Make this value the midpoint of the interval.</p></li>
          <li><p>Use the <m>z</m>-interval procedure as above for the augmented sample size of <m>(n + 4)</m>: <m>\tilde{p} \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})}{n+4}}</m></p></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, with 95% confidence, the idea is to pretend you have 2 more successes and 2 more failures than you really did. For confidence levels other than 95%, researchers have recommended using the <em>Adjusted Wald</em> method: <m>\tilde{p} = (X + 0.5(z^*)^2)/(n + (z^*)^2)</m> and <m>\tilde{n} = n + (z^*)^2</m> so the interval becomes <m>\tilde{p} \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})}{\tilde{n}}}</m>.

          I am 95% confident that the underlying mortality rate at St. George's Hospital is between 0.477 and 0.951.

      <title>Compare Intervals for Larger Study</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Repeat for the larger study at St. George's that revealed 71 deaths out of 361 operations. How do the 95% Wald and Plus Four intervals compare in this case (compare the centers and widths)?
        </p>
        <p>
          Wald interval: <var width="40"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus Four interval: <var width="40"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparison: <var width="60"/>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <response/>
      <solution>
        <p>
          With the larger sample size, the intervals are more similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wald: (0.156, 0.238); Plus four: (0.160, 0.241)
