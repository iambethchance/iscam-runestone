      <title>Key Idea</title>
      <p>
        The <term>confidence level</term> of an interval procedure is supposed to indicate the long-run percentage of intervals that capture the actual parameter value, if repeated random samples were taken from the identical process. As such, the confidence level presents a measure of the <em>reliability</em> of the <em>method</em>. A <term>confidence interval</term> procedure is considered valid when the achieved long-run coverage rate matches (or comes close to) the stated (aka <em>nominal</em>) confidence level.
      </p>
      <p>
        <term>Statistical confidence</term> is a statement about the <em>method</em>, not a probability statement about an individual interval.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      To consider whether the one sample <m>z</m>-interval is valid for this study, we can pretend we know the process probability, generate many random samples from that process, calculate confidence intervals from the simulated samples, and see what percentage of these confidence intervals capture the actual value of the process probability that we specified.

      Because the <m>z</m>-interval procedure has the sample size conditions of the Central Limit Theorem, there are scenarios where we should not use this <m>z</m>-procedure to determine the confidence interval. In these cases, one option is to use the Exact Binomial distribution (Clopper-Pearson) method.

      The Clopper-Pearson method will have a coverage rate of at least 95%, but tends to be "conservative," meaning the coverage rate is higher than 95% so the intervals are longer than they need to be. The method is also fairly complicated (as opposed to: "go two standard deviations on each side"). An alternative method that has been receiving much attention of late is often called the <term>Plus Four</term> procedure:
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="plus-four-definition">
      <title>Definition: <term>Plus Four</term> 95% Confidence Interval for <m>\pi</m></title>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Determine the number of successes (<m>X</m>) and sample size (<m>n</m>) in the study</p></li>
          <li><p>Increase the number of successes by two and the sample size by four, and calculate a new proportion: <m>\tilde{p} = (X + 2)/(n + 4)</m>. Make this value the midpoint of the interval.</p></li>
          <li><p>Use the <m>z</m>-interval procedure as above for the augmented sample size of <m>(n + 4)</m>: <m>\tilde{p} \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})}{n+4}}</m></p></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, with 95% confidence, the idea is to pretend you have 2 more successes and 2 more failures than you really did. For confidence levels other than 95%, researchers have recommended using the <em>Adjusted Wald</em> method: <m>\tilde{p} = (X + 0.5(z^*)^2)/(n + (z^*)^2)</m> and <m>\tilde{n} = n + (z^*)^2</m> so the interval becomes <m>\tilde{p} \pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})}{\tilde{n}}}</m>.

      <title>Key Idea</title>
      <p>
        The Plus Four method is more likely to be a 95% confidence interval method than the one-sample <m>z</m>-interval method. <alert>It is never a bad idea to use the Plus Four method.</alert>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      "Fudging our data" may seem like cheating, but there is actually some nice theory behind this method. The plus four adjustment is not that different in principle from the continuity correction we suggested with p-values. Many statisticians now recommend using this procedure over the one proportion <m>z</m>-interval procedure because it achieves the stated confidence level for any sample size and over the Clopper-Pearson binomial interval procedure because the intervals tend to be shorter (narrower). In fact, the more general case (something other than 95%) is becoming the default in many software packages. (The Blaker method in others.)

            From the Method pull-down menu select the Score interval method. Evaluate the performance of this interval method, clearly explaining your steps.

The <alert>coverage rate</alert> is close to the nominal 95% confidence level even for small sample sizes and extreme values of <m>\pi</m>.

        <title>Probability of Selecting Capturing Interval</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose that you take 1000 samples from a random process and generate a 95% confidence interval for <m>\pi</m> with each sample. If you randomly select one of these intervals, what is the probability that you will select an interval that captures <m>\pi</m>?

        <solution>
          <p>
            The probability is approximately 0.95 (or 95%). Since these are 95% confidence intervals, in the long run about 95% of the intervals will capture the true parameter value <m>\pi</m>. Therefore, randomly selecting one interval gives you about a 95% chance of selecting one that captures <m>\pi</m>.

            The probability is either 0 or 1 - we just don't know which! Once a specific interval is constructed, the parameter <m>\pi</m> either is or isn't in that interval. The "95% confidence" refers to the method, not to any particular interval. If we were to use this method repeatedly, about 95% of the intervals constructed would contain <m>\pi</m>.
