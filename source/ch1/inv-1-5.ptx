  <title>Investigation 1.5: Buttered Toast</title>

    <stack>
      <p>The folks at <em>MythBusters</em>, a popular television program on the Discovery 
      Channel, wanted to investigate whether a piece of toast that has been 
      buttered on one side is more likely to land butter/messy side down or 
      butter-side up. First, they wanted to design a toast-dropping rig that 
      would have no built-in bias for unbuttered toast to land on either side 
      when dropped. For this pilot study, they labeled the sides "top" and "bottom" for ten 
      unbuttered pieces of toast and counted how many landed "top-down."</p>

So for this null hypothesis (π = 0.55), because P(X ≥ 7) > P(X ≤ 3), we would not consider x = 7 to be "more extreme" than x = 3. Therefore, we would not include x = 7 in the p-value calculation.

  <p>There are other ways to define "more extreme" as well, and results will vary across different software packages (see Practice Problem 1.5). But the results will be more similar the more symmetric the null distribution is, and when the null distribution is skewed, adjusting for the asymmetry is generally preferred to going "the same distance" on each side or doubling the one-sided p-value.</p>

    <title>Definition: Two-sided p-values</title>
    <p>Two-sided p-values are used with two-sided alternative hypotheses (≠, not equal to). A two-sided p-value considers outcomes in both tails that are at least as rare as the observed result, where <em>at least as rare</em> could be defined as having a smaller tail probability of occurring as the observed statistic. If the null distribution is symmetric, the approaches are equivalent and the two-sided p-value will be double the one-sided p-value.</p>

    <p>These data (19 out of 48) do not provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis that toast buttered on one side is equally likely to land butter side up or down (two-sided p-value = 0.1934). In other words, it is plausible that this is a 50/50 process. However, this analysis cannot be used as proof that π = 0.50, as other values could be plausible as well. The sample data allow for many (technically, infinitely many) plausible values of this probability, as you will explore in the next investigation.</p>

  <p><alert>Discussion:</alert> Recall that the process we are using to testing our hypotheses is to first assume the null hypothesis is true. For this reason, we can never use this process as evidence <em>for</em> the null hypothesis, only lack of evidence <em>against</em> it. Keep in mind the saying "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Also, note that our evidence depends on the form of the alternative hypothesis. A more complete statement is that we do not have evidence in favor of the alternative that we specified, and that our strength of evidence could differ if we started with a different alternative hypothesis.</p>
