<title>Investigation 1.1: Friend or Foe?</title>
<!-- subtitle>Inference for a proportion</subtitle> -->
<p>In this first investigation you will be introduced to a basic statistical investigation as well as some ideas and terminology that you will utilize throughout the course. You will combine ideas from the preliminary investigations: examining distributions of data and simulating models of random processes to help judge how unusual an observation would be for a particular probability model</p>

  <title>The Study</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>In a study reported in the November 2007 issue of <em>Nature</em>, researchers investigated whether infants take into account an individual's actions towards others in evaluating that individual as appealing or aversive, perhaps laying the foundation for social interaction (<url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18033298/">Hamlin, Wynn, and Bloom, 2007</url>). In other words, do children who aren't even yet talking still form impressions as to someone's friendliness based on their actions?</p>
    
        <p>In one component of the study, sixteen 10-month-old infants were shown a <q>climber</q> character (a piece of wood with <q>googly</q> eyes glued onto it) that could not make it up a hill in two tries.</p>
        
        <p>Then the infants were shown two scenarios for the climber's next try, one where the climber was pushed to the top of the hill by another character (the <q>helper</q> toy) and one where the climber was pushed back down the hill by another character (the <q>hinderer</q> toy). The infant was alternately shown these two scenarios several times.</p>

        <p>Then the child was presented with both pieces of wood (the helper and the hinderer characters) and asked to pick one to play with.</p>

      <p>A <term>sample</term> is a collection of observed outcomes generated by repeated realizations a random process. The set of observations should reflect the typical behavior, and the variability inherent in that process. A study's <term>sample size</term> is the number of outcomes observed.</p>

    <title>Drawing Conclusions Beyond the Sample</title>
    
    <p>Clearly a majority/more than half of the infants chose the helper toy in this sample of 16 infants. But does that convince us that infants in general are more likely to pick the helper toy in the long run? In other words, what is the probability that an infant will choose the helper toy?</p>
    
    <p><em>Model assumption:</em> Note we are assuming each infant has the same probability of picking the helper toy, we just don't know the value of that probability.</p>

    <p>Our analysis approach is going to be to assume the second explanation is true (similar to how in a legal trial we assume a defendant is innocent), and then see whether our data are consistent or inconsistent with that assumption. To do this, we need to investigate the values we expect to see for the number choosing the helper toy when 16 infants are equally choosing between the two toys. As you saw with the Random Babies (Investigation B), we can simulate the outcomes of a random process to help us determine which outcomes are more or less likely to occur.</p>

These results will help us assess the variability in the outcomes of 16 infants "just by chance."

    <p>For a 50-50 simulation model, we can flip a fair coin. We can arbitrarily define <q>heads</q> to be choosing the helper toy and <q>tails</q> to be choosing the hinderer toy. We will repeat the random process 16 times to represent the 16 infants, and we will count how many times we flip heads, representing an infant choosing the helper toy. The chart below shows this mapping of the real world, which we saw one instance of, and the simulation model, which we can easily repeat many times.

        <p>Now that we have a better picture of the long-run behavior of this process, discuss whether you would consider option 2 before Question 12: <q>Infants choose equally between the two toys in the long run and we happened to get 'lucky' and find most of the infants in our sample picking the helper toy</q> to be a plausible conclusion for this study. Explain your reasoning as if to a skeptic.</p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>Look at how often 14 or more heads occurred in your 2,000 simulated repetitions. Is this common or rare? What does this tell you about the plausibility of the "no preference" assumption?</p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>Because it is very unlikely for us to have seen results at least as extreme as what we observed (14 successes) under the assumption of 50-50 chance, we have evidence against this claim and instead in favor of the claim that there is something other than random chance at play in this sample.</p>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    
    <p>Returning to our legal trial analogy, if you decide that the observed <q>data</q> is unlikely to occur by chance alone, you are going to <q>reject</q> the assumption of <q>innocence</q> (and say we have evidence the defendant is guilty). If you decide the data/evidence is not unusual by chance alone, then you <q>fail to reject</q> that assumption (and we say we don't have evidence the defendant is guilty <mdash/> we aren't proving the defendant innocent, just that the evidence is not inconsistent with that assumption, <q>not guilty</q>).</p>
    
    <p>So based on these simulation results, we would say the data (14 helper choices out of 16 trials) is unusual under the assumption that infants genuinely have no preference and are choosing blindly when presenting the toys. This evidence convinces us that <q>There is something to the theory that infants are genuinely more likely to pick the helper toy (for some reason)</q> is the more believable explanation for why so many of the infants in this study picked the helper toy over the hinderer toy. We haven't proven this is true, but based on the strong majority these researchers saw, even for this small sample size of 16, we would consider the evidence convincing (<q>beyond a reasonable doubt</q>) that, in the long run, the probability of choosing the helper toy in this random process is greater than 0.5. Because the researchers controlled for other possible explanations for the observed preference results like color and handedness, we will conclude that there is convincing evidence that infants really do have a genuine preference for the helper toy over the hindering toy.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    
    <p>In a study of <q>social evaluation,</q> researchers explored whether pre-verbal infants have a preference for a <q>helping</q> toy over a <q>hindering</q> toy. Treating the 16 infants as identical observations from a random process with equal probability of success/failure, we find that getting 14 infants choosing the helper toy is not consistent with the types of values we expect to see when we have <q>infants</q> choosing equally between the two toys. This means that the researchers' data provide strong statistical evidence to reject this <q>no preference</q> model and conclude that the infants' choices are actually governed by a process where there is a genuine preference for the helper toy (or at least that it's more complicated than each infant flipping a coin to decide). Of course, this conclusion depends on the assumption of <q>identical infants</q> and that these 16 infants' choices are representative of the larger process of viewing the videos and selecting a toy. Also keep in mind that not all infants had a clear preference for either object.</p>
