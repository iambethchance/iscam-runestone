  <title>Are You Clairvoyant?</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>A standard test for extra-sensory perception (ESP) asks subjects to identify which of five symbols (e.g., circle, plus, square, diamond, waves) is on the front of a card, viewed by the experimenter but not the subject. The experimenter concentrates on the symbol and a <q>hit</q> is when the subject correctly identifies the symbol being viewed by the experimenter. The subject is given several trials, with the viewed symbol randomly determined for each of the trials, with no discernible pattern.</p>

  <p>Online tests are available as well. Take the <url href="http://www.psychicscience.org/esp1" target="_blank">Quick ESP Test</url> (scroll down to CLICK TO LOAD, and then press Start) to test your clairvoyance (predicting what's about to happen rather than reading what someone else is thinking). Click on the card that you believe is about to be shown. Repeat for 10 rounds, keeping tracking of the number of hits in your first 10 attempts.</p>

    <hint>
      <p>What is the sample size? What was measured about each observation?</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>The random process is the repeated attempts to identify the symbol correctly. The sample size is the 10 trials. Variable = correct/incorrect identification (categorical). The sample size is 10.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Do you consider it reasonable to model your observations as coming from a binomial random process? Explain your reasoning.</p>

    <response/>
    <hint>
      <p>Consider the four conditions for a binomial process: two outcomes, independence, fixed number of trials, and constant probability.</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>If the target symbols are randomly selected (equally likely), the student uses the same method each time, and the student is not more likely to correctly identify some symbols more than others (e.g., guessing each time) then a binomial process does seem reasonable.</p>

    <title>Terminology Detour: Statistic vs. Parameter</title>
    
    <p>In analyzing data, it is important to differentiate between a <term>statistic</term> and the <term>parameter</term>. The observed statistic is a (known) numerical value that summarizes the observed results, whereas the parameter is the same numerical summary but applied to the underlying random process that generated the data. The value of the statistic is what we observe in the study, whereas the value of the parameter is rarely known.</p>
    
    <p>In Investigation 1.1, the statistic could be either the number (14) or the proportion (0.875) of infants who chose the helper toy. The parameter would then be the long-run probability of an infant picking the helper toy. In the case of a binomial random variable, we will use the symbol <m>\pi</m> (lower case Greek letter for <q>p</q>) to represent this unknown process probability.</p>

      <p>A parameter describes a long-run probability or proportion for the entire process, not just your sample result.</p>

If we were to simulate this random process, could we toss coins? If not, suggest another way we could generate simulated results assuming the null hypothesis to be true.

        <p>Coin tosses give 50/50 probability. Does your null hypothesis assume 50% chance of success?</p>

        <p>We can model <m>C</m> with the binomial distribution:</p>
        <p><ul>
          <li><p>Each trial has two outcomes: correct match or not</p></li>

          <li><p>The probability of success (if someone is guessing) is the same for each trial (<m>= 0.20</m> if using 5 cards each trial). We aren't changing the number of cards or anything else from trial-to-trial.</p></li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>We can't toss a coin because we are not assuming 50/50 for success/failure. To model 0.20 we could use spinners.</p>

  <p>If your observed number of successes was below the mean, then you can conclude that your data do not provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis and you should not start your own psychic hotline!

          <p>It is not a coincidence that the value of 9 appears in both and is close to the expected value + 2 SD.

      <exercise xml:id="I1-3-19" label="Four symbols">
        <title>Test with Four Symbols</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Suppose you changed the test to use only 4 symbols. Does this change the expected number or standard deviation for the number of hits when a subject is guessing? How many would someone need to identify correctly to convince you they could perform better than guessing in the long-run?</p>
        </statement>
        <response/>
        <hint>
          <p>With 4 symbols, the probability of guessing correctly changes to 1/4 = 0.25. Recalculate the expected value and SD using this new probability, then find how many hits would be 2 SD above the mean.</p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>This would increase the probability of a correct guess to 0.25, and so the probability model would need to change as well. If there are only 4 cards, the probability of a correct guess increases to 0.25. So, with 25 attempts, the expected value would be <m>25(0.25) = 6.25</m> with an SD of <m>\sqrt{25(0.25)(0.75)} = 2.17</m>. So <m>6.25 + 2(2.17) = 10.59 \approx 11</m>. Notice that this <q>cutoff</q> value went up (10 or 11 vs. 9). This is because guessing is more likely to do well so we need more evidence that someone is not guessing. Also, using the applet, <m>P(C \geq 10) = 0.097</m> and <m>P(C \geq 11) = 0.044</m>.</p>

    <title>Summary</title>
    
    <p>The number of correct answers in 25 attempts, for someone who is guessing, can be modeled with a binomial distribution (assuming the probability of a correct answer is 0.20 each time and there is no pattern from attempt to attempt). In this case, the hypothesized value for the probability of <q>success</q> will be 0.20 rather than 0.5 due to the five cards to choose from, which we could model with spinners rather than coin tosses. If someone is simply guessing, in the long run they will guess correctly by chance alone 20% of the time. This means that if we give someone 25 attempts, we expect them to answer correctly <m>0.20 \times 25 = 5</m> times (on average, in the long run), with a standard deviation of <m>\sqrt{25(0.20)(0.80)} = 2</m> hits in 25 attempts. Keep in mind that the <q>statistical significance</q> of an outcome will depend on both the mean and the standard deviation of the null distribution. In this case, someone would need 9 or more hits to be more than 2 standard deviations above the mean, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.048. (It is not a coincidence that the 0.05 cut-off gives very similar results to the 2SD cut-off.)</p>
