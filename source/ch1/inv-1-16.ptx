    <title>The Data</title>

  <p><em>Literary Digest</em> was a well-respected political magazine founded in 1890. Using sampling, they correctly predicted the presidential outcomes from 1916–1932. In 1936, they conducted the most extensive (to that date) public opinion poll in history. They mailed out questionnaires (postcards) to over 10 million people (about one-fourth of voters), hand addressing more than a quarter million postcards per day) whose names and addresses they obtained from club rosters, city directories, and (mostly) vehicle registration lists and telephone books.</p>

  <p>Based on almost 2.4 million responses (2,376,523), the <em>Literary Digest</em> predicted that 54% of voters would vote for Republican Alf Landon (then governor of Kansas) in the upcoming presidential election, and only 41% would vote for Democrat Franklin Roosevelt (the incumbent).</p>

    <title>Calculate sample statistic</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Why is <m>1293669/(1293669 + 972897) = 0.57</m> not equal to 0.54?</p>
      <p><var width="60"/></p>

    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>The 0.57 represents the proportion among just Landon and Roosevelt (the two main candidates), while 0.54 includes other candidates like William Lemke (Union Party) in the denominator.</p>

  <p>Have you ever heard of Alf Landon? He lost. By a landslide. Incumbent Democrat Franklin Roosevelt won the election, carrying 60.8% of the popular vote to Landon's 36.5%.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-c">
    <title>Explain polling error</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Give two plausible explanations why the <em>Literary Digest</em> prediction was so much in error. In particular, talk about the direction of the bias – why was this sampling method vulnerable to producing an overestimate of the parameter?</p>
    </statement>
    <response>
    </response>
    <solution>
      <p>1. Oversampled Republicans because Republicans tended to have more money for cars, phones, etc. in 1936 (bad sampling frame)</p>
      <p>2. Voluntary response bias. More likely to hear from unhappy people (vs. supporting the incumbent)</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <p>Still, a 24% response rate is much higher than current polls and this was the Digest's largest poll yet, shouldn't this improve their prediction? How are current polls with smaller response rates and smaller sample sizes able to be more accurate? One reason suggested for the error in 1936 was that the Digest had consistently been having more Republican voters responding to their straw vote. Does the data support this argument?</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Now find the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_United_States_presidential_election">actual 1932 election results</url>, what proportion of voters voted for the Republican (Hoover) candidate (among the three major candidates)?

    <solution>
      <p>15,761,254/(15,761,254 + 22,821,277 + 73,158) = 0.399</p>
      <p>The proportion who claimed to vote Republican in the survey (0.507) is noticeably larger than the proportion that actually voted Republican (0.399). This supports the suspicion that the survey overrepresented Republicans compared to the voting population.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Post Stratification</title>
    <p>In the 1936 poll, about 51% of respondents said they voted Republican in 1932, but only about 40% of the actual voters in 1932 voted Republican, a ratio of 0.78. So the <em>Digest</em>'s sample appear to overrepresent the Republican voters. Similarly, persons who said they voted Democrat or Other in the 1932 election were unrepresented in the 1936 poll (ratios: 1.197, 2.23 respectively). (Lohr and Brick, 2017, also estimated the ratio for the non-voters and missing to be 1.1275 for Democrats and 0.871 for Republicans.)</p>

    <p>This means we want to lower the number of Republican votes in the <em>Digest</em> poll by multiplying by 0.78, to adjust for the overrepresentation in the sample, and increase the number of Democrat votes in the poll by multiplying by 1.197 and so forth.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-i">
    <title>Calculate adjusted percentage</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Between these two candidates, what is the adjusted percentage voting for Roosevelt? Is this larger or smaller than the original <em>Literary Digest</em> prediction?</p>
      <p><var width="60"/></p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>Proportion (for these two) voting Roosevelt is now about 0.497 (49.7%), up from 0.429 for the 2 candidates (though still below half).</p>
      <p>This is larger than the original <em>Literary Digest</em> prediction.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <p>Although this is still much lower than the actual vote share for Roosevelt between these two candidates (62%), you can see how this process tries to account for the sampling bias in the original poll. There are still a lot of assumptions, e.g., respondents accurately reported their 1932 vote, and non-respondents to the LD survey had the same relationship between the 1932 and 1936 votes as the respondents. But if you apply this technique to the individual states, 10 states change from Landon to Roosevelt, including California and New York, and Roosevelt is predicted to win 26 states (276 electoral votes), rather than 16 states (161 electoral votes).</p>

      <description>Comparison chart 1 for different correction methods</description>
    </image>
 
  <p>So using this one other piece of information would have at least predicted the correct outcome, though still way underestimating the margin of victory. More complicated weighting schemes further adjust based on the size of the error in the 1928 LD poll or use a regression model based on the previous two elections. The <em>Literary Digest</em> also collected but did not publish data on postmarks of returned ballots and could have adjusted for rural/urban differences or county-level demographics from the 1930 census.</p>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>There were two main issues in the <em>Literary Digest</em> poll. One, the sampling frame did not include all members of the population of interest and in particular failed to include those that were poorer (and at that time likely to be Democrats). Second, the voluntary response nature of the poll implies the surveyors were more likely to hear from those unhappy with the status quo (incumbent candidate) or with more time on their hands to complete such surveys (e.g., retired folks), and even those more willing to pay for a stamp. Both of these probably point to an overrepresentation of Republicans. Bad sampling frames and voluntary response bias are perhaps the most common sources of sampling error. By the way, a fledgling pollster of the time, George Gallup, actually bet that he would predict the percentages more accurately. Not only did he correctly predict the <em>Digest</em> result with only 3,000 respondents, he also correctly predicted a Roosevelt victory! The issues with the <em>Literary Digest</em> poll were evident in earlier elections (overpredicting the popular vote for the winner in 1924 and 1928, but the results were so one-sided, the bias didn't matter), and even though they could have weighted the results, they chose not to and let readers "draw their own conclusions." But Lohr and Brick (2017) point out that the largest issue was probably failing to accurately assess the uncertainty in their estimates.</p>

    <p>In the mid-1980s, Dr. Shere Hite, actress and writer, and subject of a 2023 documentary, undertook a survey of women's attitudes toward relationships, love, and sex by distributing 100,000 questionnaires in women's groups. Of the 4500 who returned the questionnaire, 96% said that they gave more emotional support than they received from their husbands or boyfriends. An <em>ABC News/Washington Post</em> poll surveyed a random sample of 767 women, finding that 44% claimed to give more emotional support than they received.</p>
