  <title>Investigation 1.16: Literary Digest</title>

  <p>Literary Digest was a well-respected political magazine founded in 1890. Using sampling, they correctly predicted the presidential outcomes from 1916–1932. In 1936, they conducted the most extensive (to that date) public opinion poll in history. They mailed out questionnaires (postcards) to over 10 million people (about one-fourth of voters), hand addressing more than a quarter million postcards per day) whose names and addresses they obtained from club rosters, city directories, and (mostly) vehicle registration lists and telephone books.</p>

  <p>Based on almost 2.4 million responses (2,376,523), the Literary Digest predicted that 54% of voters would vote for Republican Alf Landon (then governor of Kansas) in the upcoming presidential election, and only 41% would vote for Democrat Franklin Roosevelt (the incumbent).</p>

      <p>Variable: Presidential vote preference; Type: Categorical (binary)</p>
      <p>Population of interest: All U.S. voters in 1936; Sample: 2,376,523 respondents to the Literary Digest poll</p>
      <p>Sampling frame: People with names/addresses from club rosters, city directories, vehicle registration lists, and telephone books</p>
      <p>Parameter: <m>\pi</m> = proportion of all 1936 voters who would vote for Landon (unknown)</p>
      <p>Statistic: <m>\hat{p}</m> = 0.54, proportion of poll respondents who said they would vote for Landon</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-b">
    <title>Calculate actual proportion</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Why is <m>1293669/(1293669 + 972897) = 0.57</m> not equal to 0.54?</p>
      <p><var width="60"/></p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>The 0.57 is the proportion among the two main candidates (Landon and Roosevelt only), while 0.54 includes all candidates in the poll.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <p>Have you ever heard of Alf Landon? He lost. By a landslide. Incumbent Democrat Franklin Roosevelt won the election, carrying 60.8% of the popular vote to Landon's 36.5%.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-c">
    <title>Explain polling error</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Give two plausible explanations why the Literary Digest prediction was so much in error. In particular, talk about the direction of the bias – why was this sampling method vulnerable to producing an overestimate of the parameter?</p>
      <p><var width="60"/></p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>1. The sampling frame (vehicle registration and telephone book lists) excluded poorer Americans who couldn't afford cars or phones, and these voters tended to be Democrats.</p>
      <p>2. Voluntary response bias - those who chose to respond may have been more dissatisfied with the incumbent (Roosevelt) or had more time/resources to complete and mail surveys, potentially overrepresenting Republicans.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <p>Still, a 24% response rate is much higher than current polls and this was the Digest's largest poll yet, shouldn't this improve their prediction? How are current polls with smaller response rates and smaller sample sizes able to be more accurate? One reason suggested for the error in 1936 was that the Digest had consistently been having more Republican voters responding to their straw vote. Does the data support this argument?</p>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-d">
    <title>Calculate 1936 poll proportion</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Open the LitDigest1936.xls file in Excel or Google Sheets. This contains the raw counts for the three main candidates (including William Lemke, Union Party), as well as an overall total number of straw votes cast in each state. For these 3 candidates, what percentage of the poll respondents said they would vote for Republican Landon in the 1936 election? [Hint: Set up a column formula in row 52, using columns C and AA.]</p>
      <p><var width="20"/></p>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-f">
    <title>Compare to actual 1932 results</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Now find the actual 1932 election results, what proportion of voters voted for the Republican (Hoover) candidate (among the three major candidates)? Did the Literary Digest poll have too many or too few Republican voters? How could we account for this in our estimates of vote count?</p>
      <p><var width="60"/></p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>In the actual 1932 election, approximately 40% voted for Republican Hoover. The Literary Digest poll had too many Republican voters (51% vs 40%). We could weight the responses to adjust for this overrepresentation.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Post Stratification</title>
    <p>In the 1936 poll, about 51% of respondents said they voted Republican in 1932, but only about 40% of the actual voters in 1932 voted Republican, a ratio of 0.78. So the Digest's sample appear to overrepresent the Republican voters. Similarly, persons who said they voted Democrat or Other in the 1932 election were unrepresented in the 1936 poll (ratios: 1.197, 2.23 respectively). (Lohr and Brick, 2017, also estimated the ratio for the non-voters and missing to be 1.1275 for Democrats and 0.871 for Republicans.)</p>
    
    <tabular halign="center">
      <row header="yes">
        <cell></cell>
        <cell>Republican</cell>
        <cell>Democrat</cell>
        <cell>Socialist, Other</cell>
        <cell>Non-voters</cell>

        <cell>Dem: 1.1275<lb/>Repub: 0.871</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    
    <p>This means we want to lower the number of Republican votes in the Digest poll by multiplying by 0.78, to adjust for the overrepresentation in the sample, and increase the number of Democrat votes in the poll by multiplying by 1.197 and so forth.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-g">
    <title>Adjust Landon votes</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Start with the Landon voters in the Digest poll, using the breakdown by how they voted in 1932, adjust the counts using the above ratios [Hint: Set up a formula using these weights and the breakdown of the planned Landon voters by the 1932 vote, columns D-I, to find a new count.

  <exercise xml:id="I1-16-i">
    <title>Calculate adjusted percentage</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Between these two candidates, what is the adjusted percentage voting for Roosevelt? Is this larger or smaller than the original Literary Digest prediction?</p>
      <p><var width="60"/></p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>The adjusted percentage for Roosevelt is approximately 48-50% (between these two candidates), which is larger than the original Literary Digest prediction of 41%.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <p>Although this is still much lower than the actual vote share for Roosevelt between these two candidates (62%), you can see how this process tries to account for the sampling bias in the original poll. There are still a lot of assumptions, e.g., respondents accurately reported their 1932 vote, and non-respondents to the LD survey had the same relationship between the 1932 and 1936 votes as the respondents. But if you apply this technique to the individual states, 10 states change from Landon to Roosevelt, including California and New York, and Roosevelt is predicted to win 26 states (276 electoral votes), rather than 16 states (161 electoral votes).</p>

  <p>So using this one other piece of information would have at least predicted the correct outcome, though still way underestimating the margin of victory. More complicated weighting schemes further adjust based on the size of the error in the 1928 LD poll or use a regression model based on the previous two elections. The Literary Digest also collected but did not publish data on postmarks of returned ballots and could have adjusted for rural/urban differences or county-level demographics from the 1930 census.</p>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>There were two main issues in the Literary Digest poll. One, the sampling frame did not include all members of the population of interest and in particular failed to include those that were poorer (and at that time likely to be Democrats). Second, the voluntary response nature of the poll implies the surveyors were more likely to hear from those unhappy with the status quo (incumbent candidate) or with more time on their hands to complete such surveys (e.g., retired folks), and even those more willing to pay for a stamp. Both of these probably point to an overrepresentation of Republicans. Bad sampling frames and voluntary response bias are perhaps the most common sources of sampling error. By the way, a fledgling pollster of the time, George Gallup, actually bet that he would predict the percentages more accurately. Not only did he correctly predict the Digest result with only 3,000 respondents, he also correctly predicted a Roosevelt victory! The issues with the Literary Digest poll were evident in earlier elections (overpredicting the popular vote for the winner in 1924 and 1928, but the results were so one-sided, the bias didn't matter), and even though they could have weighted the results, they chose not to and let readers "draw their own conclusions." But Lohr and Brick (2017) point out that the largest issue was probably failing to accurately assess the uncertainty in their estimates.</p>
