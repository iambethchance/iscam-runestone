    <title>Investigation 1.8: Halloween Treat Choices</title>
    
    <p>
      Obesity has become a widespread health concern, especially in children. Researchers believe that giving children easy access to food increases their likelihood of consuming extra calories. <url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12859885/" visual="pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12859885">Schwartz, Chen, and Brownell (2003)</url> examined whether children would be willing to take a small toy instead of candy at when trick-or-treating on Halloween. They had seven homes in 5 different towns in Connecticut present children with a plate of 4 toys (stretch pumpkin men, large glow-in-the-dark insects, Halloween theme stickers, and Halloween theme pencils) and a plate of 4 different name brand candies (lollipops, fruit-flavored chewy candies, fruit-flavored crunchy wafers, and "sweet and tart" hard candies) to see whether children were more likely to choose the candy or the toy. The houses alternated whether the toys were on the left or on the right. Data were recorded for 284 children between the ages of 3 and 14 (who did not ask for both types of treats).

          For a binomial distribution, the mean is <m>n\pi</m> and the standard deviation is <m>\sqrt{n\pi(1-\pi)}</m>.

          When <m>\pi</m> is close to 0 or 1, the binomial distribution becomes more skewed. We need both <m>n\pi</m> and <m>n(1-\pi)</m> to be large enough to ensure the distribution is symmetric enough to be well-approximated by a normal distribution. If <m>\pi</m> is very small, even with a large <m>n</m>, we might not have enough expected successes for the normal approximation to work well.

      There are actually some nice advantages to using the normal distribution rather than the binomial distribution, though less so as computers have become so advanced. For one, tail probabilities can be approximated by finding the area under the normal curve rather than summing binomial probabilities.

        <p>
          Yes, the researchers should be pleased! The lack of significance means there's no strong evidence that children prefer candy over toys. This is good news because it suggests that offering toys as an alternative to candy is viable - children are willing to accept toys instead of candy. If there had been strong evidence of a preference for candy, it would suggest that offering toys wouldn't be an effective strategy to reduce candy consumption.

          The exact binomial p-value should be closer to the simulated p-value. This is expected because the simulation approximates the true binomial distribution, while the normal approximation is just that - an approximation to the binomial.

          In the binomial distribution <m>P(X = 135) = 0.220</m>. What is <m>P(X = 135)</m> with the normal distribution? How do <m>P(X &lt; 135)</m> and <m>P(X \leq 135)</m> compare in each distribution?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <response/>
      <hint>
        <p>
          For a continuous distribution, the probability of any exact value is 0.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          With the normal distribution (continuous), <m>P(X = 135) = 0</m> because the probability of any exact value is 0 for a continuous distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the binomial distribution (discrete): <m>P(X \leq 135) = P(X &lt; 135) + P(X = 135)</m>, so these are different values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the normal distribution (continuous): <m>P(X \leq 135) = P(X &lt; 135)</m> because <m>P(X = 135) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      To make the normal probability (which is finding <m>P(X &lt; 135)</m>) closer to the binomial probability, which finds <m>P(X \leq 135) = P(X &lt; 135) + P(X = 135)</m>, we want to include more of the area under the normal curve above 135 in our calculation. A continuity correction does this by using the normal distribution to find <m>P(X &lt; 135.5)</m> instead. This does not change the binomial probability but should enlarge the normal probability.

      <title>Apply Continuity Correction</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the One Proportion Inference applet, specify 135.5 in the As Extreme As box (if using number of successes as the statistic, otherwise use <m>135.5/284 \approx 0.477</m> instead) and press Count. What does the applet use for the right-side cut-off? Why? How does the p-value change? Is it now more similar to the binomial p-value?

      <response/>
      <hint>
        <p>
          By symmetry, what value on the right side corresponds to 135.5 on the left side?
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The applet uses 148.5 for the right-side cut-off. This is because 135.5 is 6.5 below the mean of 142, so by symmetry, we need 6.5 above the mean: <m>142 + 6.5 = 148.5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The p-value should increase slightly (become closer to 0.40) and should now be more similar to the exact binomial p-value. The continuity correction improves the normal approximation by accounting for the fact that the normal distribution is continuous while the binomial is discrete.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      Many software programs allow you to apply this continuity correction for a one-sample z-test (e.g., using <m>\hat{p} = (X \pm 0.5)/n</m> as the input) or may do so by default. However, when n is large, you may not see much difference in the values.

      <title>Study Conclusions</title>
      <p>
        If we define <m>\pi</m> to be the probability that, when presented with a choice of candy or a toy while trick-or-treating, a child chooses the toy, and if we assume the null hypothesis (<m>H_0: \pi = 0.5</m>) is true, the above calculations tell us that we would observe at most 135 children choosing candy (or at least 149 choosing toy) or at most 135 of the 284 children choosing the toy in about 40% of all possible samples from such a process. Thus, this is not a surprising outcome when <m>\pi = 0.5</m>. We fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that it's plausible that children are equally likely to choose the toy or the candy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do have some cautions with this study as it was conducted in only a few households in Connecticut, a "convenience sample," so we cannot claim that these results are representative of children in other neighborhoods. We also don't know if the children found the toys "novel" and whether their preference for toys could decrease as the novelty wears off (or if "better" candy choices were offered). Furthermore, when the children approached the door they were asked their age and gender, and for a description of their Halloween costume. The researchers caution that this may have cued the children that their behavior was being observed (even though their responses were recorded by another research member who was out of sight) or that they should behave a certain way. Still, these researchers were optimistic that alternatives could be presented to children, even at Halloween, to lessen their exposure to large amounts of candy.
