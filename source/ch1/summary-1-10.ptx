    <title>Summary: Confidence Interval Methods</title>

    <p>
      <alert>Discussion</alert> As you can tell, there are several ways to obtain a confidence interval for a process probability. When the sample size is large, they will yield very similar results for the endpoints and the coverage rate. When the sample size is small, the Adjusted Wald method is preferred. You can use the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval method when the sample size is small, but the Binomial intervals tend to be wider and don't have the estimate <m>\pm</m> margin-of-error simplicity), but is more computationally efficient than the Blaker method. Below we compare the 95% confidence intervals for the 8 of 10 and 71 of 361 studies for these methods plus a fourth, the "Score interval" which is a more direct inversion of the one sample proportion <m>z</m>-test; as well as the adjusted Blaker method discussed in Investigation 1.6.

      <em>Also note:</em> In 2013, two statisticians, Agresti and Gottard, introduced a new approach to address the Wald's method underperforming for extreme sample proportions, and found that the method was superior to the Plus Four in terms of coverage while maintaining similar interval lengths.
