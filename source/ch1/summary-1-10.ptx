      <title>Key Idea</title>
      <p>
        The Plus Four method is more likely to be a 95% confidence interval method than the one-sample <m>z</m>-interval method. <alert>It is never a bad idea to use the Plus Four method.</alert>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Fudging our data" may seem like cheating, but there is actually some nice theory behind this method. The plus four adjustment is not that different in principle from the continuity correction we suggested with p-values. Many statisticians now recommend using this procedure over the one proportion <m>z</m>-interval procedure because it achieves the stated confidence level for any sample size and over the Clopper-Pearson binomial interval procedure because the intervals tend to be shorter (narrower). In fact, the more general case (something other than 95%) is becoming the default in many software packages. (The Blaker method in others.)

      <em>Also note:</em> In 2013, two statisticians, Agresti and Gottard, introduced a new approach to address the Wald's method underperforming for extreme sample proportions, and found that the method was superior to the Plus Four in terms of coverage while maintaining similar interval lengths.
