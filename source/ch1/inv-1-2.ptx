      <p>Previous research has demonstrated that domesticated dogs can be trained to understand human cues, such as looking or pointing at an object. But it was not clear how the animals would perform with "behavioral cues" showing intent such as reaching for, but not obtaining, or trying to open an object.</p>

      <p><url href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12055-6#MOESM1">Lampe et al. (2017)</url> gave captive wolves, pack dogs living in identical conditions to the wolves, and pet dogs living with families a series of "object-choice tasks." A table was placed outside a fenced compartment, and a container was placed at each end of the table, one containing food and one empty. The experimenter would give the cue as to which container had the food and then the animal would touch one of the two targets next to the containers. A 6-year-old female timber wolf, Yukon, chose the intended container in 6 of the 8 trials with behavioral cues.</p>

    <li><p>Yukon does not consistently understand behavioral cues and is guessing randomly.</p></li>

    <title>Measuring "Rareness"</title>
    
    <p>In Investigation 1.1, the observed result (14) was pretty far in the tail of the distribution and you probably agreed that we could consider it unusual. This result (6 out of 8) is not as inconsistent with the null hypothesis; so where do we "draw the line"? First, we need agree on a measure of "rareness." We could just calculate the theoretical probability of 6 heads in 8 tosses (0.1094), but keep in mind that if we have a larger sample size (e.g., 100 tosses), then any individual outcome (e.g., 62 heads) will have a small probability. So we want to judge how extreme our observation is relative to the other observations in the simulated distribution. One way to do this is to count how many outcomes are as or even more extreme (even further from the expected value) than the observed outcome. For example, if we tell you that only 1% of rattlesnakes are longer than 2.5 meters, then you know to be very surprised to see a 3-meter rattlesnake and you may even begin to think that what you are looking at is not a rattlesnake at all!</p>
    
    <p><ul><li>In the applet, enter 6 in the <alert>Count Samples</alert> box and keep the "as extreme as" button to greater than or equal to, <m>\geq</m>. </li></ul></p>
    <exercise xml:id="inv1-2b-h" label="I1.2b.8">
      <title>Calculate p-value</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Report the proportion of the repetitions with 6 or more heads (correct choices).</p>
        <p>In 1,000 repetitions, assuming the probability of choosing correctly is 0.50, we found <var width="5"/> % of repetitions of 8 attempts to result in 6 or more successes.</p>
      </statement>
      <response/>
      <solution>
        <p>Results will vary but should be around 0.15, or 15% of repetitions resulting in 6 or more heads.</p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>
    
    <p>Notice that we consider the direction of the alternative hypothesis to help us determine which outcomes we consider "more extreme" than our observed outcome. This tail probability you found in Question 9 is referred to as the p-value.</p>
    
    <assemblage xml:id="def-pvalue-null-distribution-1-2b">
      <title>Definitions: Null Distribution and p-value</title>
      <p>Because the simulation assumes the null hypothesis to be true, we can refer to the distribution you simulated as the <term>null distribution</term><idx><h>null distribution</h><h>distribution assuming null hypothesis is true</h></idx>. When you determine the proportion of the results in the null distribution that are at least as extreme as the observed result, you are estimating a probability. We will refer to this probability as the <term>p-value</term><idx><h>p-value</h><h>probability of results as extreme as observed, assuming null hypothesis</h></idx>. We use the p-value to evaluate the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
      
      <p>The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. There are no hard-and-fast cut-off values for gauging the smallness of a p-value, but generally speaking:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li><p>A p-value above 0.10 constitutes little or no evidence against the null hypothesis.</p></li>
        <li><p>A p-value below 0.10 but above 0.05 constitutes moderate evidence against the null hypothesis.</p></li>
        <li><p>A p-value below 0.05 but above 0.01 constitutes strong evidence against the null hypothesis.</p></li>

      <title>Definition: Binomial Random Variable</title>
      <p>A <term>Binomial random variable</term><idx><h>binomial random variable</h><h>counts successes in independent trials</h></idx> counts the number of successes in a random process with the following properties:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li><p>Each trial results in either "success" or "failure" (we have a binary categorical variable).</p></li>
        <li><p>The trials are independent: The outcome of one trial does not change the probability of success on the next trial.</p></li>
        <li><p>The probability of success, <m>\pi</m>, is constant across the trials.</p></li>
        <li><p>There are a fixed number of trials, <m>n</m>.</p></li>

    </assemblage>
    
    <p>Because we are assuming the null hypothesis to be true, we are treating each attempt as an identical repetition of a random process with a probability of success of 0.50 for each attempt (always two containers to choose from), and one attempt outcome does not impact the probability of success on the next attempt (e.g., a screen was lowered between attempts and the location of the food randomized each time) so the attempts are independent. We are counting <m>X</m>, the observed number of correct choices in the <m>n = 8</m> trials. So <m>X \sim</m> (is distributed as) <m>\text{Binomial}(8, 0.50)</m> and we want to determine the probability of observing 6 or more successes in 8 attempts by chance alone, <m>P(X \geq 6)</m>. We will illustrate this calculation next, and then turn to technology to find binomial probabilities.</p>

      <solution>
        <p>No, a p-value of 0.14 is not strong evidence against the null hypothesis. It is plausible that Yukon would do as well in 8 trials even if she didn't understand the cue and was simply guessing.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>If we assume Yukon is guessing between the two containers, regardless of the cue, then finding 6 or more successes in 8 trials is actually not very surprising (binomial p-value = 0.1445); about 14% of samples from a 50/50 process would show 6 or more successes in 8 trials. This does not provide convincing evidence that Yukon can perform "above chance," but there is not information about whether other wolves or other cues would show better performance.</p>

Similar to one of the experiments they conducted, you will be asked to match photos of two faces to the names Tim and Bob. The researchers wrote that their participants "overwhelmingly agreed" on which face belonged to Tim. You will conduct a similar study in class to see whether your class also agrees with which face is Tim's more than you would expect from random chance (here "random chance" = there is no facial prototyping and people pick a name for the face on the left at random).</p>
