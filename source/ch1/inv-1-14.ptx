    <title>The Study</title>
  <sidebyside widths="65% 30%" margins="0% 0%" valign="top">
    <p>Shargorodsky, Curhan, Curhan, and Eavey (<url href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/186427">2010</url>) examined hearing loss data for 1771 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-6), aged 12<ndash/>19 years. ("NHANES provides nationally representative cross-sectional data on the health status of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.") A standardized health exam was given along with the survey and through audiometric measurements, 333 teens were found to have at least some level of hearing loss (average hearing threshold level at least 15 dB in either ear). </p>

  <p>News of this study spread quickly, many blaming the prevalence of hearing loss on the higher use of ear buds by teens. At MSNBC.com (8/17/2010), Carla Johnson summarized the study with the headline "1 in 5 U.S. teens has hearing loss, study says." We will first decide whether we consider this an appropriate headline. According to the 2008 U.S. Census, there were 21,469,780 teens in America between the ages of 15 and 19.</p>

    <title>Key Result: Central Limit Theorem for Sample Proportions (Expanded)</title>
    <p>Combining what we have learned in the last few investigations, we can expand the Central Limit Theorem for a sample proportion: When drawing random samples from a large but finite population with a large enough sample size, then the sampling distribution of the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> will be well modeled by a normal distribution with mean equal to <m>\pi</m>, the population proportion of successes, and standard deviation equal to <m>SD(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}</m>.</p>
    
    <p>We consider the sample size large enough if <m>n \times \pi > 10</m> and <m>n \times (1 - \pi) > 10</m>.</p>
    
    <p>We consider the population size (<m>N</m>) large if it is more than 20 times the size of the sample.</p>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>We have no reason to doubt that the NHANES sample will be representative of the larger population of U.S. teens. Although we are not told how they selected the sample, they claim it was nationally representative, and presumably was collected using a probability sampling method. The population size (~21 million teens) is quite large compared to the sample size of nearly 1,800 teens, so that condition for using the normal model for the sampling distribution of the sample proportions is met. The sample size is also very large relative to the hypothesized population proportion of 0.20 (0.20 × 1771 = 354.2 and 0.80 × 1771 = 1416.8; both easily exceed 10). Therefore, calculations from the binomial probability model and the normal probability model will be quite similar. Under the null hypothesis that 20% of U.S. teens have some hearing loss, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion will be approximately normal, with a mean of 0.20 and a standard deviation of 0.0095. Therefore, our sample proportion, <m>\hat{p}</m> = 333/1771 = 0.188 lies 1.26 standard deviations below the hypothesized population proportion, yielding a two-sided p-value of 0.2068 (Theory-Based Inference (TBI) applet). This p-value is not small and does not provide convincing evidence against the claim that <m>\pi = 0.20</m>. We would get sample proportions as or more extreme as 0.188 (meaning at least as far from 0.20) in about 21% of random samples from a population where 20% of teens have some hearing loss. Therefore, the headline seems appropriate. The confidence interval (TBI applet) tells us that we are 95% confident that between 17.0% and 20.6% of all U.S. teens have some form of hearing loss. (Do keep in mind that 0.20 is just one plausible value of <m>\pi</m>.) It is difficult to evaluate these values without knowing whether this percentage is increasing over time which we will investigate later.</p>

    <title>Practice Problem 1.14</title>

    <p>In 2018, the General Social Survey (GSS) used probability sampling methods to randomly select more than 2,000 adult Americans. One of the questions they asked was:</p>

    <blockquote>

Let <m>\pi</m> represent the proportion of all eligible voters who would claim to have voted in the 2016 election. The United States Election Project (<url href="http://www.electproject.org/">http://www.electproject.org/</url>), reports that 136,753,936 ballots were cast for president that year, with 230,931,921 citizens eligible to vote, corresponding to 59.2% voter turnout.
