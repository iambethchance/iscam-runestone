    <title>Investigation 1.9: Kissing the Right Way (cont.)</title>
    
    <p>
      Recall the study published in Nature that found 64.5% of 124 kissing couples leaned right to kiss (Investigation 1.6). We previously used simulation and the binomial distribution to determine which values were plausible for the underlying probability that a kissing couple leans right (<m>\pi</m>). In particular, we found 0.5 and 0.74 were not plausible values for <m>\pi</m> but 0.6667 was. The 95% Clopper-Pearson Binomial confidence interval was (0.554, 0.729). Now you will consider applying the normal model as another method for producing confidence intervals for this parameter.

      <statement>

          With a sample size of 124 kissing couples, does the Central Limit Theorem predict the normal probability distribution will be a reasonable model for the distribution of the sample proportion?

      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Yes. With 124 couples and a sample proportion of 0.645, we have 80 successes (couples leaning right) and 44 failures (couples leaning left). Both are at least 10, so the CLT validity condition is satisfied.

    <note>
      <p>
        When you do not have a particular value to be tested for the process probability, it's reasonable to use the sample proportion in checking the sample size condition for the CLT. (This is equivalent to making sure there are at least 10 successes and at least 10 failures in the sample.)

    <note>
      <p>
        An approximate 95% confidence interval for the process probability based on the normal distribution would be <m>\hat{p} \pm 2\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}</m>. That is, this interval extends two standard deviations on each side of the sample proportion. We know that for the normal distribution roughly 95% of observations (here sample proportions) fall within 2 SDs of the mean (here the unknown process probability), so this method will "capture" the process probability for roughly 95% of samples.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we should admit that the multiplier of 2 is a bit of a simplification. So how do we find a more precise value of the multiplier to use, including for values other than 95%?

      <statement>
        <p>
          Use technology (see Technology Detour below) to find and report the 90% <m>z</m>-confidence interval for the probability that a kissing couple leans to the right. How do the midpoint and width of the 90% confidence interval compare to those of the 95% confidence interval?

      <hint>
        <p>
          Use the critical value from the table (1.645) or technology to find the 90% interval.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>0.645 \pm 1.645 \times 0.043 = 0.645 \pm 0.071 = (0.574, 0.716)</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          The midpoint is the same (<m>\hat{p} = 0.645</m>) for both intervals. The width of the 90% interval (0.142) is narrower than the width of the 95% interval (0.168). This is expected because we are requiring less confidence, so we can use a narrower interval.

        <solution>
          <p>
            The sample size required using Approach 2 (1068) is larger than with Approach 1 (985). Approach 2 is considered "conservative" because <m>\pi = 0.5</m> produces the largest possible value for <m>\pi(1-\pi)</m>, which maximizes the margin of error for any given sample size. By using 0.5, we ensure that regardless of the true value of <m>\pi</m>, our sample will be large enough to achieve the desired margin of error. This approach errs on the side of caution by potentially collecting more data than necessary, but it guarantees the margin of error won't exceed our specification.

      </exercise>

      <note>
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>
          We can solve for <m>n</m> by inverting the formula for the margin of error, assuming a value for <m>\pi</m>. The largest value for the margin of error occurs when <m>\pi = 0.50</m>, so that value can be used for a conservative estimate of the necessary sample size. You should always round your value up to the next integer to also ensure the margin of error won't exceed the specification. Notice that this calculation is much more difficult with a binomial confidence interval which does not have a simple formula to manipulate.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Recall from Practice Problem 1.8B that a student wanted to assess whether her dog Muffin tends to chase her blue ball and her red ball equally often when they are rolled at the same time. The student rolled both balls a total of 96 times, each time keeping track of which ball Muffin chased. The student found that Muffin chased the blue ball 52 times and the red ball 44 times. We arbitrarily decided to treat the blue ball as "success."

            The margin of error increases when we require more confidence (99% vs 95%).
