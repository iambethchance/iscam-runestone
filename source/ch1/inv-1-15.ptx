  <title>Investigation 1.15: Counting Concussions</title>

  <sidebyside widths="65% 30%" valign="top">
    <p>Concussions, particularly among high school and collegiate athletes, have been given increased attention in recent years. A 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey found about 15.1% of U.S. high school students reported having at least one concussion in the previous year. Prevalence was higher among those who played on a sports team.</p>

  <p>A student project group was interested in the probability of concussion among the male soccer and football players at their university. They sent a survey to the team rosters and found that 12 of the 33 respondents reported at least one concussion in the previous two years (2017<ndash/>2019). The anonymous survey was emailed to all 110 players, and included a list of injuries asking "yes or no questions about various injuries, in order to distract the athletes of the true purpose of our survey." Based on these data, is there evidence that the proportion of all 110 male soccer and football players at this university who had at least one concussion in the last 2 years is larger than 0.15?</p>

  <p>We can still ask: "If the population proportion was 0.15, would it be unlikely for a random sample from this population to produce such a large sample proportion?"

  </exercise>

  <p>You should find your answers in <xref ref="I1-15-f"/> are not quite the same. This illustrates a violation of the independence assumption of our binomial model. However, if the population is large compared to the size of the sample, then the conditional probabilities are almost equal, and we can approximate with a binomial distribution. But when the population is not large, we need to take that lack of independence into account.</p>

  <assemblage>
    <title>Key Result: Sampling Without Replacement</title>
    <p>When sampling without replacement from a finite population that is not more than 20 times the size of the sample, the "trials" are no longer independent.</p>
  </assemblage>

  <p>The consequence is that we should not use the binomial distribution to calculate <m>P(X \geq 12)</m>. Instead of a calculation like <m>\binom{33}{12}(0.155)^{12}(1-0.155)^{21}</m>, we would need a calculation like</p>
  <me>(17/110)(16/109) + \ldots + (17/110)(17/109) \ldots</me>
  <p>for all the possible sequences of outcomes. Turns out there is a different probability distribution we can use called the <term>hypergeometric distribution</term><idx>hypergeometric distribution</idx>.</p>

  <p>To calculate hypergeometric probabilities, we need to consider another probability rule.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When outcomes are equally likely, then the probability of an event equals the number of ways for the event to happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For example, there are 268 words in the Gettysburg Address, 125 contain the letter e (about 46.6%) and 143 do not. Using counting rules, there are <m>\binom{268}{5} = 11,096,761,368</m> different samples of 5 words that we could select from the Gettysburg Address. But if we want to select one e-word and four non-e-words, there are <m>\binom{125}{1} \times \binom{143}{4} = 2,087,710,625</m> such samples. Thus, if <m>X</m> = number of e-words in a sample of 5 words, we find <m>P(\text{one e-word}) = P(X = 1) = 2,087,710,625 / 11,096,761,368 \approx 0.188</m>.</p>

    <title>Probability Detour <mdash/> Hypergeometric Random Variables</title>
    
    <p>To be a <term>Hypergeometric random variable</term><idx>Hypergeometric random variable</idx>, a random process must have the following properties:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><p><m>n</m> observations are drawn without replacement from a population of <m>N</m> objects.</p></li>
      <li><p>There are two distinct types of objects in the population, <m>M</m> successes and <m>N - M</m> failures.</p></li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p>The main distinction between a hypergeometric random variable and a binomial random variable is the trials are no longer independent. The probability of drawing a success for the first object is <m>M/N</m>. But if we do draw a success, then the probability of success for the second object is <m>(M - 1)/(N - 1)</m>. If we replaced the item, then we would be back to a binomial process.</p>
    
    <p>In general, the probability of obtaining <m>k</m> successes from a population with <m>M</m> successes and <m>N - M</m> failures is</p>
    <me>P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{M}{k} \times \binom{N-M}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}</me>

    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>The hypergeometric distribution is able to tell us that if we listed all possible samples of 33 players from this population, how many would be at least as extreme as the observed sample. In many sampling situations, our population size is large enough that the binomial distribution gives a very reasonable approximation to the exact p-value. For this reason, the binomial p-value is much more commonly used than the hypergeometric p-value.</p>

    <p>These probability calculations work out to be very similar! This happens when the finite population we are sampling from is large compared to our sample size (e.g., <m>N > 20 \times n</m>). This means we can continue to use the binomial distribution to determine such probabilities and the expected number of successes <m>5(0.466) \approx 2.33</m> with <m>SD(X) \approx 1.115</m> successes. And when the sample size is large relative to the probability of success, we can approximate the binomial with the normal distribution.</p>

    <title>Study Conclusions</title>
    <p>Only about 0.02% of random samples of 33 players from a population of 110 players with 17 successes would have 12 or more successes in the sample by random chance (random sampling) alone. This survey would give us very strong evidence that the proportion of players with at least one concussion in this population was larger than 0.155, but there are many problems with this conclusion. This was not a random sample from the population of all athletes at this school (voluntary response, no follow-up) and is likely susceptible to sampling bias. Perhaps athletes who recently had a concussion would be more motivated to voluntarily complete the survey. Because of these issues with the sampling method, the p-value that we calculated is really not all that appropriate or meaningful. We should also consider that the 15% value cited by the YRBS came from one year of data vs. during the previous two years. Nevertheless, getting accurate reports on concussion rates is a challenging but critical task in helping to prevent possibly debilitating injuries, especially in high contact high school and college sports.</p>
