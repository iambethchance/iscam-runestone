  <title>Modelling</title>
<p>A <em>model</em> is an artificial representation or a simplification of something more complicated, like a toy airplane. Models can be useful in making predictions (e.g., weather models) or to help us better understand the phenomena under study. For example, what factors impact the severity of a hurricane?</p>

  <p><ul>
    <li><p>Move the red hurricane symbol to a circle on the map and read what happens.</p></li>
    <li><p>Switch between the Sea Surface Temperature, Moisture, and Wind maps to see the data for each circle.</p></li>
    <li><p>Which circles create the strongest hurricanes? Why?</p></li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-a" label="IC.1">
    <title>Explain Hurricane Formation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In your own words, explain how sea surface temperature, moisture, and wind interact to create strong hurricanes - or weaken them.</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>Descriptions will vary. For example: Warm water is essential to fuel the storm. When humid air goes up, rainfall occurs, helping hurricanes form. If the speed of upper wind in a certain area is too fast, hurricanes won't form. If the upper wind levels are calmer, this creates a more likely environment for a hurricane to form.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-b" label="IC.2">
    <title>Evaluate Model Accuracy</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Explain how you could evaluate the accuracy of this model of hurricane strength. What would you do next if you decided the model was not appropriate?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>Opinions will vary. We could compare the predictions to recent data to see how well they match up. If the results don't match up, we could gather more data in order to improve the model. This could include additional variables we haven't considered yet.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>In this course, you will encounter two main types of models: <term>statistical models</term> and <term>probability/simulation models</term>. For example, the Random Babies simulation in Investigation B, allowed you to simulate hypothetical data to estimate probabilities of different events. As long as the model valid, we can predict that all four mothers receiving the correct babies would not happen very often in the long run. Most models rely on simplifying assumptions, like babies being returned <q>completely at random.</q></p>
  
  <p>The graphs below show histograms of the hurricane data with different probability models (red curves).</p>

    <title>Compare Graphical Displays</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Describe the difference between a histogram and a dotplot. When might histograms be more useful?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>Histograms bin the observations rather than trying to represent each individual value. They are more useful in looking at the overall distribution for a larger number of observations.</p>

    <title>Select Best Model</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Which model (red curve) do you consider a better match to the observed data?</p>

      <choice>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement><p>Right curve</p></statement>
      </choice>
    </choices>
    <solution>
      <p>The curve on the left is more symmetric whereas the curve on the right has a right skewedness to it. The right skew appears to better match up with the histogram.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-e" label="IC.5">
    <title>Define Statistical Model</title>
    <statement>
      <p>What does the term <q>model</q> mean in this situation? Why would such a model be useful? What assumptions would you need to make?</p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>Which do you consider more likely, a year with 13 hurricanes or with 14?</p>
    </hint>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>By "model," we are looking for a simpler representation of the general pattern in the histogram. A mathematical model can then be used to make predictions about future observations, as long as the "process" is not changing. In particular, while we didn't observe a year with 13 hurricanes, the model would predict that could happen, but rarely.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>To get an idea of a statistical model, you will collect some data:</p>
  
  <p><ul>
    <li><p>Using a measurement tool provided by your instructor, measure the circumference of a tennis ball.</p></li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-measurement" label="IC.measurement">
    <title>Record Your Measurement</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Record your measurement here (to the nearest hundredths place): <var width="10"/> cm</p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-f" label="IC.6">
    <title>Examine Measurement Variation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Did everyone in class find the same value? What are some possible explanations for different measurements?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>We suspect not everyone will find the same exact measurement. There could be different measurement techniques, different lighting at the time of the measurement, different tennis balls.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>We can think of these measurements as observations from a random process, which we can summarize with a statistical model. If we consider 28.5cm the <q>true value,</q> then we can write our statistical model as</p>
  
  <p>Measurement recorded = 28.5 + random error</p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-g" label="IC.7">
    <title>Estimate Measurement Error</title>
    <statement>
      <p>How could we estimate the likely amount of random error in your class's measurement process?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>You could consider the standard deviation as a measure of a typical prediction error from the mean.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>Much of what scientists do is try to measure, explain, and minimize the amount of random variation.</p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-h" label="IC.8">
    <title>Reduce Measurement Error</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Suggest a way to reduce the measurement error in your class's process.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-i" label="IC.9">
    <title>Understand Measurement Model</title>
    <statement>
      <p>What does the term <q>model</q> mean here? Why would such a model be useful? What assumptions need to be made?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <solution>
      <p>Again the model is a simpler representation of the measurement process. This would help us make predictions or identify observations that seem way different from what we might expect due to more typical measurement errors.</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <subsection xml:id="practiceCA">
    <title>Practice Problem C.A</title>
    
    <p>Researchers often compare data generated from a model to observed data to help validate the model. If the model's data reasonably matches the observed data, that helps confirm that they (the model builders) understand the underlying data generating process.</p>
