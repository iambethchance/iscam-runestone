  <title>0 Investigation C: Modelling Hurricanes</title>
  
  <p>A model is an artificial representation or a simplification of something more complicated, like a toy airplane. Models can be useful in making predictions (e.g., weather models) or to help us better understand the phenomena under study. For example, what factors impact the severity of a hurricane?</p>

  <p><ul>
    <li><p>Move the red hurricane symbol to a circle on the map and read what happens.</p></li>
    <li><p>Switch between the Sea Surface Temperature, Moisture, and Wind maps to see the data for each circle.</p></li>
    <li><p>Which circles create the strongest hurricanes? Why?</p></li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-a" label="IC.1">
    <title>Explain Hurricane Formation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>In your own words, explain how sea surface temperature, moisture, and wind interact to create strong hurricanes - or weaken them.</p>

    <title>Evaluate Model Accuracy</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Explain how you could evaluate the accuracy of this model of hurricane strength. What would you do next if you decided the model was not appropriate?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>In this course, you will encounter two main types of models: <term>statistical models</term> and <term>probability/simulation models</term>. For example, the Random Babies simulation in Investigation B, allowed you to simulate hypothetical data to estimate probabilities of different events. As long as the model valid, we can predict that all four mothers receiving the correct babies would not happen very often in the long run. Most models rely on simplifying assumptions, like babies being returned <q>completely at random.</q></p>
  
  <p>The graphs below show histograms of the hurricane data with different probability models (red curves).</p>

    <title>Define Statistical Model</title>
    <statement>
      <p>What does the term <q>model</q> mean in this situation? Why would such a model be useful? What assumptions would you need to make? [Hint: Which do you consider more likely, a year with 13 hurricanes or with 14?]</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>To get an idea of a statistical model, you will collect some data:</p>
  
  <p><ul>
    <li><p>Using a measurement tool provided by your instructor, measure the circumference of a tennis ball.</p></li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-measurement" label="IC.measurement">
    <title>Record Your Measurement</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Record your measurement here (to the nearest hundredths place): <var width="10"/> cm</p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-f" label="IC.6">
    <title>Examine Measurement Variation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Did everyone in class find the same value? What are some possible explanations for different measurements?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>We can think of these measurements as observations from a random process, which we can summarize with a statistical model. If we consider 28.5cm the <q>true value,</q> then we can write our statistical model as</p>
  
  <p>Measurement recorded = 28.5 + random error</p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-g" label="IC.7">
    <title>Estimate Measurement Error</title>
    <statement>
      <p>How could we estimate the likely amount of random error in your class's measurement process?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>Much of what scientists do is try to measure, explain, and minimize the amount of random variation.</p>
  
  <exercise xml:id="inv-c-h" label="IC.8">
    <title>Reduce Measurement Error</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Suggest a way to reduce the measurement error in your class's process.</p>

    <title>Understand Measurement Model</title>

      <p>What does the term <q>model</q> mean here? Why would such a model be useful? What assumptions need to be made?</p>

  <subsection xml:id="practiceCA">
    <title>Practice Problem C.A</title>
    
    <p>Researchers often compare data generated from a model to observed data to help validate the model. If the model's data reasonably matches the observed data, that helps confirm that they (the model builders) understand the underlying data generating process.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>Suggest and label four possible sources of variation in the tennis ball measurements. Enter them as the four pie charts and conjecture sizes and probabilities for those sources (e.g., right now, Spinner 1 assumes a perfect measurement with 0.50 probability, a -.1 cm error with 0.25 probability and a +.1 cm error with 0.25 probability).
