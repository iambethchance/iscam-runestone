  <title>Chapter 4, Section 4: Matched Pairs Designs</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this section, you will again compare two sets of quantitative observations but with one key difference in how the data were collected. You will see advantages to collecting data with a "paired" design, and then you will investigate how to make the corresponding changes in the appropriate analyses.</p>
