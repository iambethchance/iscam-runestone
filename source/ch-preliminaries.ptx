      <title>Investigation A: Hurricanes and Climate Change</title>
      
      <p>One of the concerns with climate change is an increased number of tropical storms (including hurricanes and major hurricanes). In particular, in the "Atlantic Basin," scientists have tracked the number of "named storms" since 1851. 
      According to the <url href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/" target="_blank">National Hurricane Center</url>:</p>

        <title>Evaluate the Evidence</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Does this convince you that climate change is leading to an increase in the number of hurricanes (in the Atlantic)? If so, explain why. If not, explain what additional information you would want to know.</p>
        <hint>
          <p>Consider: Is comparing just two years enough evidence? What about natural year-to-year variation?</p>
        </hint>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Just because one year saw a large increase doesn't necessarily reflect an increasing trend. It's also hard to know whether this is a "large" increase when we don't have information on how much this value tends to vary from year to year. We can't draw any causal conclusions because other things could have changed in that time frame. We also need to keep in mind that "number of hurricanes" is just one possible reflection of "climate change."</p>

        <title>Assess Reported Mean</title>
        <statement>
          <p>The stormfax website reports the mean number of hurricanes between 1991-2020 to be 7. Does that appear consistent with the graph? Why do you think they chose that subset of years?</p>
        <hint>
          <p>Consider what's special about the 1991-2020 period. Is it the most recent data? Why might recent data be more relevant?</p>
        </hint>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>This is consistent with the time plot. If we were to put a horizontal line at a height that goes through the middle of the values, 7 appears a reasonable value for that height. Perhaps they wanted to look at more recent data for more direct comparison with current data (opinions may vary).</p>

        <response/>
      </exercise>
      
      <p>Oftentimes a mean or average is reported, but with no measure of spread or variability. If all the years between 1991-2020 had between 6 and 8 hurricanes, we would react very differently to 14 hurricanes in one year than if all the years between 1991-2020 had between 2 and 15 hurricanes.</p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="def-standard-deviation">
        <title>Terminology Detour: Standard Deviation</title>
        <p>The most common measure of the variability in a distribution of data is the <term>standard deviation</term><idx><h>standard deviation</h><h>the square root of the variance; a measure of spread in the outcomes of a distribution; roughly the average deviation from the mean of the distribution</h></idx>.</p>
        <p><me>s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}}</me></p>
        <p>We can roughly interpret the standard deviation as the average "deviation" of the data values in the distribution from the mean of the distribution. Another interpretation: If we were to predict 7 as the number of hurricanes in a year between 1991-2020, the standard deviation would approximate the average "prediction error" for those years.</p>

      <p>In this investigation, you have just touched on one piece of information related to climate change. In fact, scientists are less concerned about the number of storms but in the intensity of the storms and how warming of the surface ocean may be leading to more destructive storms. Looking at a single year in isolation or even a pair of years creates a very incomplete picture of trends over time, and while we expect some natural variation from year-to-year, the question to scientists is whether the overall trend being observed is larger than what we can reasonably attributed to natural variation.</p>

        <title>Points to keep in mind</title>
        <ul>
          <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
          <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
          <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
          <li>The quality of your inferences will depend A LOT on the quality of the data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data or data from a completely different time period.</li>

      <paragraphs xml:id="discussion-a">
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>When exploring a research question, one of the first steps is to define the variable involved, e.g., the number of hurricanes. This is an example of <term>quantitative variables</term>, as opposed to a <term>categorical variable</term> like whether the storm has winds over 74 mph. Dotplots are good choices for visualizing a quantitative variable for a small dataset. When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Center</em>: What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
          <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
          <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
          <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To summarize the center of the distribution, we often report the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h><h>the average of all numerical values in the data set</h></idx> (the arithmetic average of all the numerical values in the data set) and/or the <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h><h>a value such that at least 50% of the observations in the data set are smaller than that value and at least 50% of the observations in the data set are larger than that value</h></idx> (a middle value such that 50% of the data values are smaller and 50% are larger).</p>

      <p>Because it is clearly not feasible to actually carry out this horrible child-returning process over and over again, we will instead <em>simulate</em> the random process to investigate what would happen in the long run. Suppose the four babies were named Murphy Miller, Wallis Williams, Bari Brown, and Shea Smith. Take four index cards and write the first name of each baby on a different card. Now take a sheet of paper and divide it into four regions, one for each mom. Next shuffle the index cards, face down, and randomly deal the babies back to the mothers. Flip the cards over and count the number of moms who received the correct baby.</p>
      
      <p>Carry out this physical simulation at least 5 times and record your results.</p>

        <p>One disadvantage to using simulation to estimate a probability like this is that everyone will potentially obtain a different estimate. Even with a very large number of trials, your result will still only be an estimate of the actual long-run probability. For this particular scenario however, we can determine exact theoretical probabilities.</p>
        
        <p>First, let's list all possible outcomes for returning four babies to their mothers at random. We can organize our work by letting 1234 represent the outcome where the first baby went to the first mother, the second baby to the second mother, the third baby to the third mother, and the fourth baby to the fourth mother. In this scenario, all four mothers get the correct baby. As another example, 1243 means that the first two mothers get the right baby, but the third and fourth mothers have their babies switched.</p>

      <p>You could have determined the number of possible outcomes without having to list them first. For the first mother to receive a baby, she could receive any one of the four babies. Then there are three babies to choose from in giving a baby to the second mother. The third mother receives one of the two remaining babies and then the last baby goes to the fourth mother. Because the number of possibilities at one stage of this process does not depend on the outcome (which baby) of earlier stages, the total number of possibilities is the product <m>4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24</m>. This is also known as <m>4!</m>, read "4 factorial." Because the above outcomes are equally likely, the probability of any one of the above outcomes occurring is <m>1/24</m>.

          <p>Interpret the expected value in context. Does this mean that in any given trial, we expect this many mothers to receive the correct baby?</p>
        <hint>
          <p>Remember that expected value is a long-run average, not a prediction for a single trial.</p>
        </hint>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>The expected value of 1 means that in the long run, on average, 1 mother will receive the correct baby per trial. This does NOT mean that in any single trial we expect exactly 1 match - in fact, we could get 0, 1, 2, or 4 matches. The expected value is the average across many trials.</p>

        <response/>
      </exercise>
      
      <p>Notice that if we wanted to compute the average number of matches, say after 1000 trials, we would look at a weighted average:</p>
      
      <p><me>\bar{x} = \frac{1 + 0 + 2 + 0 + \cdots}{1000} = \frac{(\# \text{ of } 0\text{s}) \times 0 + (\# \text{ of } 1\text{s}) \times 1 + (\# \text{ of } 2\text{s}) \times 2 + (\# \text{ of } 4\text{s}) \times 4}{1000}</me></p>
      
      <p>But from the results we saw above, each term <m>(\#)/1000</m> converges to the probability of that outcome as we increase the number of repetitions, giving us the above formula for <m>E(X)</m>. So we will interpret the expected value as the long-run mean of the outcomes.</p>
      
      <p>Another property of a random variable is its <term>variance</term><idx><h>variance</h><h>measures variability in values of a random variable</h></idx>. This measures how variable the values of the random variable will be.

      <p>A model is an artificial representation or a simplification of something more complicated, like a toy airplane. Models can be useful in making predictions (e.g., weather models) or to help us better understand the phenomena under study. For example, what factors impact the severity of a hurricane?</p>

      <p>In this course, you will encounter two main types of models: <term>statistical models</term> and <term>probability/simulation models</term>. For example, the Random Babies simulation in Investigation B, allowed you to simulate hypothetical data to estimate probabilities of different events. As long as the model valid, we can predict that all four mothers receiving the correct babies would not happen very often in the long run. Most models rely on simplifying assumptions, like babies being returned <q>completely at random.</q></p>
