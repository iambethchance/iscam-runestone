  <p>These first three investigations give you a <em>very</em> brief introduction to some big ideas for the course. Some of you will have seen some of these ideas before and can use the investigations to refresh your memory. Some of the ideas may be new and you will see them again in later chapters. For now, try to focus on the bigger picture of analyzing data, evaluating models, and drawing appropriate conclusions. </p>
  <exercises xml:id="exercises-0-a" hidden-label="yes"><title>Investigation A: Hurricanes and Climate Change</title>
 
  <p>One of the concerns with climate change is an increased number of tropical storms (including hurricanes and major hurricanes). In particular, in the "Atlantic Basin," scientists have tracked the number of "named storms" since 1851. 
  According to the <url href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/" target="_blank">National Hurricane Center</url>:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><term>Tropical Storm</term><idx><h>tropical storm</h><h>a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph</h></idx>: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph (34 to 63 knots).</li>
    <li><term>Hurricane</term><idx><h>hurricane</h><h>a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph or higher</h></idx>: A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher. In the western North Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons; similar storms in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean are called cyclones.</li>
    <li><term>Major Hurricane</term><idx><h>major hurricane</h><h>a tropical cyclone with max sustained winds of 111 mph or higher</h></idx>: A tropical cyclone with max sustained winds of 111 mph (96 knots) or higher.</li>
  </ul>

    <title>Evaluate the Evidence</title>
    <statement>
      <p>Does this convince you that climate change is leading to an increase in the number of hurricanes (in the Atlantic)? If so, explain why. If not, explain what additional information you would want to know.</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <hint>
      <p>Consider: Is comparing just two years enough evidence? What about natural year-to-year variation?</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>Just because one year saw a large increase doesn't necessarily reflect an increasing trend. It's also hard to know whether this is a "large" increase when we don't have information on how much this value tends to vary from year to year. We can't draw any causal conclusions because other things could have changed in that time frame. We also need to keep in mind that "number of hurricanes" is just one possible reflection of "climate change."</p>

      <p>Each dot represents data from one observational unit. What is being measured here? How many observations do we have?</p>

  <p>A year with 14 hurricanes is certainly close to record setting, but we expect there to be some variation from year to year. Below is a timeplot of the number of hurricanes each year.</p>

      <p>Think about what a timeplot shows that a dotplot doesn't - how does it arrange the data differently?</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>Now we know which year each value corresponds to and we might see a gradual increasing trend overall since about 1970. We also see that the change from 6 to 14 is a rather large change between years.</p>

    <title>Assess Reported Mean</title>
    <statement>
      <p>The stormfax website reports the mean number of hurricanes between 1991-2020 to be 7. Does that appear consistent with the graph? Why do you think they chose that subset of years?</p>
    </statement>
    <response/>
    <hint>
      <p>Consider what's special about the 1991-2020 period. Is it the most recent data? Why might recent data be more relevant?</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>This is consistent with the time plot. If we were to put a horizontal line at a height that goes through the middle of the values, 7 appears a reasonable value for that height. Perhaps they wanted to look at more recent data for more direct comparison with current data (opinions may vary).</p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
  
  <p>Oftentimes a mean or average is reported, but with no measure of spread or variability. If all the years between 1991-2020 had between 6 and 8 hurricanes, we would react very differently to 14 hurricanes in one year than if all the years between 1991-2020 had between 2 and 15 hurricanes.</p>
  
  <assemblage xml:id="def-standard-deviation">
    <title>Terminology Detour: Standard Deviation</title>
    <p>The most common measure of the variability in a distribution of data is the <term>standard deviation</term><idx><h>standard deviation</h><h>the square root of the variance; a measure of spread in the outcomes of a distribution; roughly the average deviation from the mean of the distribution</h></idx>.</p>
    <p><me>s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}}</me></p>
    <p>We can roughly interpret the standard deviation as the average "deviation" of the data values in the distribution from the mean of the distribution. Another interpretation: If we were to predict 7 as the number of hurricanes in a year between 1991-2020, the standard deviation would approximate the average "prediction error" for those years.</p>

    <hint>
      <p>Look at the timeplot - does the 1991-2020 period appear different from earlier decades?</p>

      <p>Answers will vary, but one might think the average is a bit higher in this more recent time frame than across the entire data set.</p>

    <hint>
      <p>Look at the dotplot - what's a typical distance from the mean of 7.2? Most values fall within what range?</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>About half or a little more than half of the values appear to fall between 4 and 10, so maybe a standard deviation of around 3 hurricanes?</p>

      <p>Compare the spread in the 1991-2020 dotplot to the spread in the full 1851-2024 dotplot.</p>
    </hint>
    <solution>
      <p>The largest values (e.g., 14, 15) are in this subset and the spread in the values does appear larger in the more recent years than overall (fewer values in the 3 to 7 range compared to the full dataset?).</p>

  <assemblage xml:id="def-standardizing">
    <title>Terminology Detour: Standardizing</title>
    <p>The general formula for standardizing an observation's position in the distribution is:</p>
    <p><me>\frac{\text{observation value} - \text{mean of distribution}}{\text{standard deviation of distribution}}</me></p>
    <p>We will often consider a value far from the mean of a distribution if it is more than two standard deviations away.</p>

  <p>In this investigation, you have just touched on one piece of information related to climate change. In fact, scientists are less concerned about the number of storms but in the intensity of the storms and how warming of the surface ocean may be leading to more destructive storms. Looking at a single year in isolation or even a pair of years creates a very incomplete picture of trends over time, and while we expect some natural variation from year-to-year, the question to scientists is whether the overall trend being observed is larger than what we can reasonably attributed to natural variation.</p>
  
  <insight xml:id="points-to-keep-in-mind">
    <title>Points to keep in mind</title>
    <ul>
      <li>It's important to determine which variables are most relevant to the research question and whether you can collect the data you need to answer the question.</li>
      <li>Simple graphs can be very informative, but you should also take care in considering the most meaningful variable representation of what you are studying even before you begin graphing.</li>
      <li>It is imperative to consider variability and to think about possible sources of variation. Sometimes you may be able to explain and "control for" a source of variation. Often you will have to dig deeper into reasons for unusual observations and whether it is appropriate to remove them from the analysis.</li>
      <li>The quality of your inferences will depend A LOT on the quality of the data that are collected. Not much can be learned from poorly or improperly collected data or data from a completely different time period.</li>
    </ul>
  </insight>
  
<paragraphs>    <title>Discussion</title>
    <p>When exploring a research question, one of the first steps is to define the variable involved, e.g., the number of hurricanes. This is an example of <term>quantitative variables</term>, as opposed to a <term>categorical variable</term> like whether the storm has winds over 74 mph. Dotplots are good choices for visualizing a quantitative variable for a small dataset. When looking at a distribution of a single quantitative variable like this, we are often interested in three key features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Center</em>: What would you consider a "typical" value in the distribution?</li>
      <li><em>Variability</em>: How clustered together or consistent are the observations? Or are they far apart?</li>
      <li><em>Shape</em>: Are some values more common than others? Are the values symmetric about the center?</li>
      <li>Are there any <em>unusual observations</em> that don't follow the overall pattern? Are there any explanations for these values?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To summarize the center of the distribution, we often report the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h><h>the average of all numerical values in the data set</h></idx> (the arithmetic average of all the numerical values in the data set) and/or the <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h><h>a value such that at least 50% of the observations in the data set are smaller than that value and at least 50% of the observations in the data set are larger than that value</h></idx> (a middle value such that 50% of the data values are smaller and 50% are larger).</p>
    
    <p>With most investigations we will also provide a follow-up practice problem or two for you to try on your own to assess your understanding of the material.</p>

      <title>Shape of Distributions</title>
      <p>The shape of a distribution is often classified as <term>symmetric</term><idx><h>symmetric</h><h>a distribution with a mirror image on each side of the center</h></idx> (mirror image on each side of the center) or <term>skewed</term><idx><h>skewed</h><h>a distribution with a longer tail on one side</h></idx>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The <term>skewness statistic</term> measures the lack of asymmetry in a distribution (due values above the mean extend further than values below the mean on average) using a <m>(y_i-\bar{y})^3</m> term.
