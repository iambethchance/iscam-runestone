    <p>The previous section focused on quantitative data arising from two independent random samples. This section will focus on quantitative data arising from randomized experiments. We will again consider simulation-based, exact, and theory-based p-values, as well as what assumptions we need to make for confidence intervals.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Investigation 4.4: Lingering Effects of Sleep Deprivation</h2>

      <div class="introduction">
        <p>Researchers have established that sleep deprivation has a harmful effect on visual learning (the subject does not consolidate information to improve on the task). Stickgold, James, and Hobson (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1200_1237">2000</a>) investigated whether subjects could <q>make up</q> for sleep deprivation by getting a full night's sleep in subsequent nights.</p>
      
        <div class="sidebyside w60-35">
          <p>This study involved randomly assigning 21 subjects (volunteers between the ages of 18 and 25) to one of two groups: one group was deprived of sleep on the night following training with a visual discrimination task, and the other group was permitted unrestricted sleep on that first night. Both groups were allowed unrestricted sleep on the following two nights, and then were re-tested on the third day.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Subjects' performance on the test was recorded as the minimum time (in milliseconds) between stimuli appearing on a computer screen for which they could accurately report what they had seen on the screen. Previous studies had shown that subjects deprived of sleep performed significantly worse the following day, but it was not clear how long these negative effects would last. The data presented here are the improvements in reaction times (in milliseconds), so a negative value indicates a decrease in performance.</p>

          <p>We want to simulate the random assignment by assuming everyone would get the same improvement score, regardless of which group they end up in, and randomly assign the subjects into 2 groups of <m>n<sub>1</sub> = 11</m> and <m>n<sub>2</sub> = 10</m>.

      <p><alert>Statistical Inference</alert></p>
      
      <p>As with the <q>dolphin therapy</q> experiment from Chapter 3, we again need to judge the strength of evidence that the experimental data provide in support of the researchers' conjecture that sleep deprivation has a harmful effect on learning. We are now working with a quantitative response variable rather than a categorical one, but we will use the same basic logic of statistical significance: We will ask whether the observed experimental results are very unlikely to have occurred by chance variation if the explanatory variable has no effect, that is, if the values in the two groups are interchangeable. To simulate this randomization test: We will take the observed response variable outcomes, randomly distribute these numerical values between the two groups, compute the statistic of interest (e.g., the difference in group means), repeat this process a large number of times, and see how often the random assignment process alone produces a difference in group means as extreme as in the actual research study. This is similar to what you considered in Investigation 4.1. However, this time it is not really feasible to list out all possible <m>C(21,10) = 352,716</m> random assignments and consider the value of the statistic for each one, so we will simulate a large number of random assignments instead. Note, we need to know the value of <m>(x̄<sub>1</sub> - x̄<sub>2</sub>)</m>, not just the <q>number of successes</q> as with the dolphin therapy study.</p>

        <div class="solution">
          <p>Results will vary. Looking at just one simulated difference is not enough because we need to understand the entire distribution of what could happen by chance alone to determine how often (what proportion of the time) random assignment alone produces results as extreme as what we observed.</p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        
        <p>The exact randomization distribution consists of every possible random assignment and calculates the statistic of interest (e.g., difference in means) for each one. Then we simply count how many of the configurations result in a value of the statistic at least as extreme (as defined by the alternative hypothesis) as the actual observed result. As you might expect, it can be extremely tedious, even with computers, to list out all of these possible random assignments. And these group sizes are relatively small! One shortcut is to only count how many assignments give results more extreme than the one observed, but as you will see we can often appeal to a mathematical model as well.</p>

        <div class="assemblage-title">Study Conclusions</div>
        
        <p>These data come from a randomized, comparative experiment. The dotplots and descriptive statistics reveal that, even three days later, the sleep-deprived subjects tended (on average) to have lower improvements than those permitted unrestricted sleep. To investigate whether this difference is larger than could be expected from random assignment alone (assuming no real difference between the two treatment conditions, our null hypothesis), you simulated a <strong>randomization test</strong> by assigning the 21 measurements (improvement scores) to the two groups at random. You should have found that random assignment alone rarely produced differences in group means as extreme as in the actual study (the <q>exact</q> p-value is less than 0.01). Thus, we have fairly strong evidence that the average learning improvement is genuinely lower for the sleep deprived subjects. Moreover, because this was a randomized comparative experiment and not an observational study, we can draw a causal conclusion that the sleep deprivation was the cause of the lower learning improvements. However, the subjects were college-aged volunteers, so we may not want to generalize these results to a much different population.</p>
